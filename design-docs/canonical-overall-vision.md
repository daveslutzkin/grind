# Canonical One-Pager — Mastery RPG (v2, Working Title)

## Core Fantasy

A **mastery-driven RPG** where the pleasure comes from **understanding transparent systems**, **planning under known uncertainty**, and **adapting intelligently to realised outcomes**.

Players are rewarded not just for choosing high expected-value strategies, but for:
- selecting risk profiles deliberately
- recognising when luck has shifted the game state
- and pivoting plans when reality diverges from expectation.

This is a game for players who enjoy:
- deep system understanding
- optimisation with intent
- visible trade-offs
- and making smart decisions after the dice have been rolled.

---

## Design Pillars

### 1. Mastery Through Explicit Systems

All meaningful mechanics are **visible and quantified**.

- Drop rates, probabilities, efficiencies, caps, and modifiers are inspectable
- The game never lies to the player
- Progress comes from understanding systems, not guessing

Mastery is demonstrated not only by selecting optimal strategies upfront, but by:
- recognising when variance has created new opportunities
- abandoning previously optimal plans when conditions change
- exploiting temporary advantages before they decay

Knowing *when* to deviate is as important as knowing *what* is optimal.

---

### 2. RNG as a First-Class Concept

Randomness is **acknowledged, measured, and surfaced**, not hidden.

All probabilistic systems expose:
- Expected value
- Variance
- Player outcomes vs expectation
- Streaks (good and bad)

The game explicitly tells players when they have been:
- lucky
- unlucky

Bad-luck protection exists and is explicit.

RNG is something players **plan around**, not something they are gaslit by.

Variance exists to:
- create asymmetry between players and timelines
- generate meaningful divergence
- and force strategic reassessment

Good play is not eliminating variance, but **choosing when and how to engage with it**.

---

### 3. Optimisation Is About Choice, Not One Correct Route

For any meaningful goal, there are **multiple viable strategies**, each with clear trade-offs:

- fast vs safe
- consistent vs high-variance
- time-heavy vs resource-heavy
- preparation-heavy vs execution-heavy

No single “correct” farm, build, or route should dominate.

If a single strategy becomes obviously dominant in short- or medium-horizon play, the system has failed — **even if that strategy is interesting in isolation**.

The game must preserve tension between:
- safety and acceleration
- consistency and volatility
- commitment and flexibility

---

### 4. Chunky Progression & Feasibility Cliffs

Progression is intentionally **lumpy**, not smooth.

- Levels, unlocks, and items create feasibility cliffs
- Power arrives in steps, not gradients
- Breakthroughs can meaningfully alter future strategy

These cliffs are deliberate:
- they create excitement
- they justify early risk
- they make success feel transformative rather than incremental

XP exists, but **levels and unlocks are the true currency of progress**.

---

### 5. Guilds as the Structural Backbone

Guilds are not flavour — they are the **primary progression scaffolding**.

Each guild functions as:
- a narrative faction (identity, reputation)
- a skill progression structure (training, unlocks, caps)
- a physical presence (multiple world locations)
- a class or profession home

Guilds issue **contracts**, not chores:
- procedurally generated
- with explicit risk/reward terms
- modifiers that affect danger, variance, and efficiency

Players choose how much risk to take.

---

### 6. Long-Lived Progression, No Resets

- No seasons
- No wipes
- No power invalidation

Progression is permanent and cumulative.

Latecomers may be behind — this is acceptable.

To maintain competition:
- leaderboards track **rates and efficiency**, not just totals
- “first to cap” and “best efficiency” races exist for new content
- prestige is earned, not reset

---

### 7. Inventory as a Core Mastery System

Inventory is **gameplay**, not UX.

- Inventory space is limited by default
- Expansion comes from:
  - skills
  - professions
  - guild unlocks
  - crafted containers

Specialised storage beats raw capacity:
- profession-specific containers
- compression vs flexibility trade-offs

Inventory management interacts with:
- travel speed
- route planning
- risk tolerance
- variance strategies

This is logistical optimisation, not busywork.

---

## World & Structure

- A single handcrafted world
- Spatial geography matters
- Travel time is meaningful early, optimisable later
- Exploration is a form of mastery

### Shared World, Instanced Resources

- Players occupy the same locations
- Mobs and resources are instanced per player (or party)
- Fast respawns
- No competition for spawns
- No griefing

Efficiency comes from planning and routing, not spawn sniping.

---

## Classes, Professions & Identity

### Classes
- Small number (≈4–6)
- Chosen at or near character creation
- Hard boundaries: some actions are impossible without the right class
- Strong mechanical identity
- No multiclassing in v1

### Professions
- Chosen early, after initial play
- Limited slots (e.g. one gathering, one crafting)
- Hard boundaries
- Mostly permanent choices

Alts are optional but rewarding.

---

## Skills & Progression

- No global character level
- Progression is entirely:
  - skill-based
  - guild reputation–based

Skills advance:
- mostly through use
- supplemented by contracts

Skill effects are roughly:
- 50% numerical improvements
- 50% capability unlocks

---

## Combat

- Real-time, tick-based (OSRS-style)
- Low APM
- Combat is about preparation:
  - gear
  - skills
  - consumables
  - target selection

“Roll the boulder up the hill, then give it a push.”

### Failure
- Low–medium consequence
- No loss of items or skills
- Death resets position and plan
- Cost is time and inefficiency, not punishment

---

## Items, Crafting & Endgame

### Items
- Items matter significantly
- Rare items are aspirational
- Known sources, explicit drop tables
- Extremely long tails are possible

### Crafting
- Deep and endgame-relevant
- Branch-heavy specialisation within professions
- All branches are theoretically completable
- Discovery is deterministic once understood

### Endgame
- No single global cap
- Many local caps across skills, guilds, and branches
- Characters can be “finished,” but only after extreme mastery

---

## Multiplayer Shape

- Multiplayer-aware from day one
- Must be a great single-player experience
- Parallel play, not dependency

Supported:
- seeing other players
- chat
- leaderboards and races
- public rare-drop announcements

Not required:
- cooperative combat
- forced grouping

Player information is fully transparent:
- skills
- gear
- reputation
- drops
- efficiencies

---

## What This Game Is Not

- Not a roguelike
- Not permadeath
- Not seasonal
- Not narrative-first
- Not economy-simulation-first
- Not twitch/action combat
- Not an infinite treadmill
- **Not a solved optimisation puzzle**

---

## Guiding Question for All v1 Decisions

**Does this system make planning under known uncertainty — and adapting to realised outcomes — more interesting?**

If not, it doesn’t belong.
