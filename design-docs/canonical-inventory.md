## Inventory Canon — Logistics as Mastery

### Purpose

Inventory is a strategic constraint, not a convenience problem.

Managing space, compression, and specialisation is a core expression of mastery.

### Laws of Inventory

1.	Inventory limits matter

•	Default inventory is intentionally constrained
•	Running out of space is expected, not exceptional

2.	Expansion comes from mastery

•	Inventory growth is unlocked via:
		•	skills
		•	professions
		•	guilds
		•	crafted containers
•	Never through raw gold sinks alone

3.	Specialisation beats raw capacity

•	Profession-specific containers:
		•	compress certain items
		•	restrict others
•	Trade-offs are explicit

4.	Inventory interacts with strategy

•	Inventory pressure affects:
		•	travel routing
		•	contract choice
		•	risk tolerance
		•	willingness to engage high-variance activities

5.	Dropping items is meaningful

•	Destroying or abandoning items is:
		•	sometimes correct
		•	sometimes painful
		•	always deliberate
•	Inventory decisions should create regret and relief

6.	Late-game optimisation is logistical

•	As combat and gathering stabilise, these become dominant mastery layers:
		•	inventory routing
		•	compression
		•	pre-staging

⸻

### Explicit Non-Goals

•	Infinite inventory
•	“Just stash everything” solutions
•	Inventory as UI friction only
•	Free teleport-to-bank loops

⸻

### Canonical Examples

•	Choosing to abandon low-value drops to chase variance
•	Specialised ore crates that block wood
•	Contracts that force tight inventory play

### Guiding Check

Does this inventory rule force the player to make a strategic sacrifice?

If not, it’s not doing its job.
