# **Canonical One-Pager — Mastery RPG (Working Title)**

## **Core Fantasy**

A **mastery- and optimisation-driven RPG** where the pleasure comes from **planning under known uncertainty**, learning deep systems, and executing efficient long-term strategies.

This is a game for players who enjoy:

* understanding systems deeply

* optimising expected value

* comparing outcomes transparently

* grinding *with intention*, not guesswork

Think:

* RuneScape’s skilling philosophy

* WoW’s itemisation and rare drops

* Championship Manager–level system transparency

* A living, handcrafted world that rewards knowledge

---

## **Design Pillars**

### **1\. Mastery Through Explicit Systems**

* All meaningful mechanics are **visible and quantified**

* Drop rates, probabilities, efficiencies, caps, and modifiers are inspectable

* Progress comes from *understanding*, not guessing

* The game never lies to the player

---

### **2\. RNG as a First-Class Concept**

Randomness is **acknowledged, measured, and surfaced**, not hidden.

* All probabilistic systems show:

  * Expected value

  * Variance

  * Player’s actual outcome vs expectation

* The game explicitly tells players when they have been:

  * Lucky

  * Unlucky

* Streaks are tracked and visible

* Bad-luck protection exists and is explicit

RNG is something players **plan around**, not something they are gaslit by.

---

### **3\. Optimisation Is About Choice, Not One Correct Route**

For any meaningful goal, there are **multiple viable strategies**, each with trade-offs:

* fast vs safe

* consistent vs high-variance

* time-heavy vs resource-heavy

* preparation-heavy vs execution-heavy

No single “correct” farm, build, or route should dominate.

---

### **4\. Guilds as the Structural Backbone**

Guilds are not flavour — they are **the primary progression scaffolding**.

Each guild functions as:

* a narrative faction (identity, reputation)

* a skill progression structure (training, unlocks, caps)

* a physical presence (multiple world locations)

* a class or profession home

Guilds issue **contracts**, not chores:

* Procedurally generated

* Explicit risk/reward terms

* Modifiers that affect danger, variance, and EV

* Players choose how much risk to take

---

### **5\. Long-Lived Progression, No Resets**

* No seasons

* No wipes

* No power invalidation

* Progression is permanent and cumulative

Latecomers may be behind — this is acceptable.

To maintain competition:

* Leaderboards focus on **rates and efficiency** as well as lifetime totals

* “First to cap” and “best efficiency” races exist for new content

* Prestige is earned, not reset

---

### **6\. Inventory as a Core Mastery System**

Inventory is **not UX** — it is **gameplay**.

* Inventory space is limited by default

* Expansion comes from:

  * skills

  * professions

  * guild unlocks

  * crafted containers

* Specialised storage beats raw capacity:

  * profession-specific containers

  * compression vs flexibility trade-offs

* Inventory interacts with:

  * travel speed

  * route planning

  * risk tolerance

  * variance strategies

Inventory management is logistical optimisation, not busywork.

---

## **World & Structure**

* A **single handcrafted world**

* Spatial geography matters

* Travel time is meaningful early, optimisable later

* Exploration is a form of mastery

### **Shared World, Instanced Resources**

* Players occupy the same locations

* Mobs and resources are instanced per player (or party)

* Fast respawns

* No competition for spawns

* No griefing

* Efficiency comes from routing and planning, not spawn sniping

---

## **Classes, Professions & Identity**

### **Classes**

* Small number (≈4–6)

* Chosen at or near character creation

* Hard boundaries:

  * Some actions are impossible without the right class

* Strong mechanical identity

* No multiclassing in v1

### **Professions**

* Chosen early, after initial play

* Limited slots (e.g. one gathering, one crafting)

* Hard boundaries

* Mostly permanent choices

Alts are optional but rewarding:

* One character can be deeply fulfilling

* Alts unlock additional systems and perspectives

---

## **Skills & Progression**

* No global character level

* Progression is entirely:

  * skill-based

  * guild reputation–based

* Skills advance:

  * mostly through use

  * supplemented by quests/contracts

* Skill effects are \~50/50:

  * numerical improvements

  * capability unlocks

---

## **Combat**

* Real-time, tick-based (OSRS-style)

* Low APM

* Combat is about preparation:

  * gear

  * skills

  * consumables

  * target selection

* “Roll the boulder up the hill, then give it a push”

### **Failure**

* Low–medium consequence

* No loss of items or skills

* Death resets position and plan

* Cost is time and inefficiency, not punishment

---

## **Items, Crafting & Endgame**

* Items matter significantly

* Rare items are aspirational

* Known sources, WoW-style drop tables

* Extremely long tails are possible

### **Crafting**

* Deep and endgame-relevant

* Branch-heavy specialisation within professions

* Example (Blacksmith):

  * Dragon

  * Elemental

  * Void

  * Gnomish

  * etc.

* All branches are theoretically completable

* Discovery is deterministic once understood

### **Endgame**

* No single global cap

* Many local caps across skills, guilds, and branches

* Characters can be “finished,” but only after extreme mastery

---

## **Multiplayer Shape**

* Multiplayer-aware from day one

* Must be a great single-player experience

* Parallel play, not dependency

Supported interactions:

* Seeing other players

* Chat

* Leaderboards and races

* Public rare-drop announcements

Not required:

* Cooperative combat

* Forced grouping

Player information is **fully transparent**:

* skills

* gear

* reputation

* drops

* efficiencies

---

## **What This Game Is Not**

* Not a roguelike

* Not permadeath

* Not seasonal

* Not narrative-first

* Not economy-simulation-first

* Not twitch/action combat

* Not an infinite treadmill

---

## **Guiding Question for All v1 Decisions**

Does this system make planning under known uncertainty more interesting?

If not, it doesn’t belong.
