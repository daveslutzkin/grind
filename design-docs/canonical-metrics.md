## Metrics Canon — What the Game Measures and Rewards

> **Implementation Status**: The metrics/leaderboard system described in this document is not yet implemented. Currently, only exploration luck tracking exists (actual vs expected ticks, luck delta, streaks). XP per tick tracking, efficiency leaderboards, variance/volatility metrics, and multi-metric comparisons are not yet functional.

### Purpose

Metrics define what mastery looks like.

What the game measures becomes what players optimise.

### Laws of Metrics

1.	Efficiency matters more than totals

- Leaderboards prioritise:
  - XP per tick
  - progress per hour
  - contracts per time
- Raw totals exist, but are secondary

2.	Variance is tracked, not hidden
- Metrics include:
  - volatility
  - luck deltas
  - streak lengths
- Players can compare:
  - skill vs luck
  - efficiency vs variance exposure

3.	Multiple metrics coexist

- No single number defines success
- Intentional trade-offs exist between:
  - speed
  - consistency
  - risk
  - mastery depth

4.	Metrics encourage comparison, not resets

- No seasons
- No wipes
- New content introduces:
  - fresh efficiency races
  - first-to-cap competitions

5.	Metrics do not prescribe play

- They describe outcomes
- Players choose what to care about

### Explicit Non-Goals

- Single “power score”
- Endless treadmill metrics
- Metrics that hide variance
- Progress resets for engagement

⸻

### Canonical Examples

- “Top 1% XP/hour miners”
- “Lowest variance combat clears”
- “Fastest contract completion with X constraints”

⸻

### Guiding Check

Does this metric reward understanding the system rather than grinding it?

If not, it’s misleading.
