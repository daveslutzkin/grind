- No constant +1% improvements forever
- No “always getting a bit stronger”

2.	No hidden systems

- No secret modifiers
- No misleading tooltips
- No fake randomness

3.	No mandatory group play

- Multiplayer is parallel, not dependent

4.	No busywork

If the answer isn’t an immediate yes, the feature doesn’t belong.
