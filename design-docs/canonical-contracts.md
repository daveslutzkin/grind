## Contract Canon — Structured Risk Selection

### Purpose

Contracts are the primary interface for choosing risk, variance, and commitment.

They are not chores.
They are optimisation problems with terms.

⸻

### Laws of Contracts

1.	Every contract exposes risk explicitly

- Expected reward
- Variance
- Time cost
- Failure conditions

Players choose contracts because of these properties.

2.	Contracts shape strategy, not behaviour

- They should suggest plans, not prescribe steps
- Multiple approaches must be viable

3.	Contracts trade safety for acceleration

- Fast contracts are riskier
- Safe contracts are slower
- High-variance contracts offer breakthroughs

4.	Contracts interact with progression

- New levels unlock:
  - new contract types
  - harder modifiers
  - higher ceilings
- Old contracts may become obsolete — this is acceptable

5.	Contracts are the main source of chunky rewards

- Reputation
- Unlocks
- Access
- Transformative items

Raw XP is secondary.

6.	Failure is informative, not punitive

- Failed contracts explain why
- They adjust future expectations
- They don’t invalidate progress

### Contract Grammar (Canonical Forms)

- Kill contracts (volume, speed, constraints)
- Gather contracts (quantity, purity, streaks)
- Hybrid contracts (multi-location, multi-skill)
- Challenge contracts (no failures, time limits)
- Variance contracts (explicitly high-risk, high-upside)

⸻

### Explicit Non-Goals

- Fetch quests
- Checklist chores
- Narrative errands
- Contracts with no meaningful decision trade-offs

⸻

### Guiding Check

Does accepting this contract meaningfully commit the player to a risk profile?

If not, it’s not a real contract
