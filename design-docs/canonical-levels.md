## Progression Canon — Levels, Unlocks, and Feasibility Cliffs

### Purpose

Progression exists to create new strategic possibilities, not to smoothly increase output.

XP is bookkeeping.
Levels and unlocks are the real currency of mastery.

### Laws of Progression

1.	Levels must change what is possible, not just how efficient

•	A level that only adds a small % bonus is incomplete
•	Every meaningful level unlocks:
		•	a new action
		•	a new risk profile
		•	a new contract type
		•	or removes a previous constraint

2.	Progression is intentionally lumpy

•	Power arrives in steps, not gradients
•	Feasibility cliffs are desirable
•	It should be common for: “This plan was impossible yesterday, trivial today”

3.	Levels justify risk retroactively

•	Early risk is often taken hoping for a breakthrough
•	When a level unlocks, past inefficiency becomes rational in hindsight

4.	Unlocks are explicit and inspectable

•	The player always knows:
		•	what the next level grants
		•	what it enables
		•	what strategies it invalidates or supersedes

5.	Numerical scaling is secondary

•	Roughly:
		•	50% of progression = new capabilities
		•	50% = numerical improvements
•	Numerical buffs exist to reinforce unlocks, not replace them

6.	Levels interact with variance

•	Higher levels often unlock higher-variance options
•	Mastery is choosing when to expose yourself to volatility

### Explicit Non-Goals

•	No smooth power curves
•	No invisible stat growth
•	No “everything gets slightly better forever”
•	No global character level

⸻

### Canonical Examples

•	Combat level unlocks:
	 •	New attack profiles (safe / volatile / greedy)
	 •	Access to new enemy types
•	Gathering level unlocks:
	 •	Vein sampling
	 •	Double-yield attempts
•	Crafting level unlocks:
	 •	Overcrafting
	 •	Specialisation branches

### Guiding Check

Does this level unlock create a new plan that didn’t exist before?

If not, it doesn’t belong
