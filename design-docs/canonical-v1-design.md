V1 Design Lock — Mastery RPG

Status: Locked
Applies to: All v1 systems, content, and balance decisions
Override requires: Explicit revision of this document

⸻

1. Purpose of This Document

This document freezes the shape of the game for v1.

It exists to:
	•	Prevent genre drift
	•	Prevent “fun” features that undermine mastery
	•	Give maintainers a hard reference when saying no

If a change conflicts with this document, the change does not ship in v1 —
even if it is clever, popular, or easy.

⸻

2. The One-Sentence Test (Non-Negotiable)

This is a mastery-driven RPG about planning under known uncertainty and adapting intelligently to realised outcomes.

Every v1 system must make that sentence more true.

If it doesn’t, it is out of scope.

⸻

3. What Is Locked for v1

3.1 The Player Fantasy (Locked)

Players succeed by:
	•	Understanding explicit systems
	•	Choosing risk profiles deliberately
	•	Recognising when luck has shifted the game state
	•	Pivoting plans accordingly

Players do not succeed by:
	•	Mechanical execution
	•	Reaction speed
	•	Guessing hidden rules
	•	Grinding a single optimal loop

⸻

3.2 RNG Philosophy (Locked)
	•	All probabilities are visible
	•	Luck is tracked and surfaced
	•	Variance creates divergence, not punishment
	•	Bad luck costs time and efficiency, not progress or power
	•	Rare outcomes are acceptable only if transformative and known-source

No hidden RNG systems may be introduced in v1.

⸻

3.3 Progression Shape (Locked)
	•	No global character level
	•	Progression is skill- and guild-based
	•	Levels are lumpy
	•	Levels unlock capabilities and risk profiles, not just numbers
	•	XP is secondary to unlocks

Smooth power curves are explicitly forbidden.

⸻

3.4 Combat Role (Locked)

Combat is:
	•	Low-APM
	•	Preparation-driven
	•	About risk exposure, not tactics or execution

Combat is not:
	•	A tactics puzzle
	•	A reflex test
	•	A mini-game with hidden optimal play

Any combat change must increase the importance of pre-fight decisions relative to in-fight actions.

⸻

3.5 Contracts as the Primary Choice Interface (Locked)

Contracts:
	•	Are optimisation problems, not quests
	•	Expose risk, variance, and reward explicitly
	•	Shape strategy without prescribing steps
	•	Are the main source of chunky rewards and unlocks

No “filler” or narrative-only contracts in v1.

⸻

3.6 Inventory as Gameplay (Locked)
	•	Inventory space is constrained by default
	•	Expansion is earned via mastery
	•	Specialisation beats raw capacity
	•	Dropping items is sometimes correct
	•	Inventory decisions affect routing, risk, and contracts

Inventory will not be reduced to QoL in v1.

⸻

3.7 Metrics & Competition (Locked)
	•	No resets, no seasons
	•	Progression is permanent
	•	Competition is based on efficiency and rates, not totals
	•	Multiple metrics coexist
	•	Variance is measured, not hidden

No single “power score” may be introduced.

⸻

4. Explicit Non-Goals for v1 (Hard Lock)

The following are out of scope for v1, even if desirable later:
	•	Roguelike structures
	•	Permadeath
	•	Twitch or action combat
	•	Tactical combat puzzles
	•	Narrative-first progression
	•	Economy simulation as a primary loop
	•	Infinite treadmills
	•	Hidden systems “for surprise”
	•	Solved optimisation paths

If a feature pushes the game toward any of these, it is rejected.

⸻

5. Allowed Evolution Inside the Lock

The following are allowed in v1, provided they respect the lock:
	•	New risk profiles
	•	New contract grammars
	•	New feasibility cliffs
	•	New ways to surface variance
	•	New ways to pivot after outcomes
	•	Additional content that stresses existing systems

Depth is encouraged. Genre drift is not.

⸻

6. The Canon Hierarchy (Important)

If documents conflict, resolve in this order:
	1.	V1 Design Lock (this doc)
	2.	Canonical One-Pager
	3.	Canonical system docs (progression, combat, contracts, etc.)
	4.	Implementation details
	5.	Balance tuning

Lower layers must conform to higher layers.

⸻

7. The Veto Test (Use This in Reviews)

Any proposed v1 change must survive all three questions:
	1.	Does this make planning under known uncertainty more interesting?
	2.	Does this increase or preserve meaningful trade-offs?
	3.	Does this avoid smoothing progression or eliminating variance?

If the answer to any is “no” or “unclear”, the change does not ship.

⸻

8. How This Lock Can Change

This document may only be changed if:
	•	The core fantasy is intentionally redefined, or
	•	v1 is declared complete

Incremental erosion is not allowed.

⸻

Final Note (Tone Matters)

This document is intentionally restrictive.

The goal of v1 is not to be everything.
It is to be coherent, legible, and hard to optimise incorrectly.

If something feels “obviously fun” but doesn’t fit here, that’s a feature — not a problem.
