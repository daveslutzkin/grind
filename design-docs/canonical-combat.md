Combat Canon — Risk Exposure, Not Execution

Purpose

Combat exists to test preparation, risk selection, and adaptation, not reflexes or tactical optimisation.

Combat is where players commit to variance.

⸻

Laws of Combat
	1.	Combat decisions are about risk, not skill
	•	No twitch mechanics
	•	No reaction tests
	•	No hidden counters or rotations
	2.	All combat probabilities are explicit
	•	Hit chances
	•	Damage ranges
	•	Drop tables
	•	Variance profiles

The player knows what dice they are rolling.
	3.	Agency happens at commitment
	•	Before combat: preparation (gear, inventory, target)
	•	At combat start: risk profile selection
	•	After combat: strategic reassessment

Mid-combat agency is allowed only if it:
	•	selects a variance profile
	•	does not require timing or execution skill

	4.	Failure costs time and opportunity, not power
	•	No loss of items, skills, or levels
	•	Death resets position and plan
	•	Inefficiency is the punishment
	5.	Combat creates information
	•	Outcomes update:
	•	luck deltas
	•	streak indicators
	•	variance trackers
	•	Failure should teach, not just delay
	6.	Preparation dominates outcomes
	•	Gear, skills, consumables, and enemy choice matter more than action selection
	•	“Roll the boulder up the hill, then give it a push”

⸻

Explicit Non-Goals
	•	Tactical combat puzzles
	•	Skill expression through timing
	•	Hidden optimal play per enemy
	•	Turning combat into a separate game

⸻

Canonical Examples
	•	Choosing between:
	•	safe, low-variance combat
	•	risky, high-upside combat
	•	Pivoting away from combat after bad streaks
	•	Doubling down after favourable variance

Guiding Check

Does this combat system make the decision to fight more interesting than the fight itself?

If not, it’s the wrong kind of combat.
