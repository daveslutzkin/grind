================================================================================

=== TICK 0 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: none
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

REASONING:
  I'm starting a text-based resource gathering game. I have no inventory, no skills, and I'm in the Town Square. My goal is to have fun while exploring this world.
  
  Looking at my options:
  - There are 6 guilds available (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers)
  - There's a Warehouse service
  - I have no known connections to other areas yet
  
  My strategy:
  1. First, I should explore the guilds to understand what skills are available
  2. The Explorers Guild seems like a good starting point - it might teach me about exploration and discovering new areas
  3. Alternatively, I could start with a practical gathering skill like Miners or Foresters
  4. Combat Guild requires a weapon, which I'd need to obtain first
  
  I'll start by visiting the Explorers Guild to learn what that skill offers, as exploration seems foundational to discovering the world and understanding the game better.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_EXPLORERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Explorers Guild

LEARNING:
  Starting fresh - need to understand guild structure, available skills, and how to gather resources efficiently.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Exploration L1
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

REASONING:
  I'm now at the Explorers Guild. The action options are "enrol" (to learn the Exploration skill) or "leave" (to go back to Town Square).
  
  Since I'm here and exploration seems like a good foundational skill to discover new areas and connections beyond the Town, I should enrol in the Exploration skill. This will likely help me:
  1. Discover new areas and locations
  2. Understand travel connections better
  3. Open up new resource gathering opportunities
  
  Let me enrol in Exploration.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Exploration"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Exploration guild, discovered Miner's Ridge (18t travel time)

LEARNING:
  Explorers Guild offers an Exploration skill that can be enrolled. This is likely a key skill for discovering new areas and connections.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)

REASONING:
  I've successfully enrolled in Exploration skill (Level 1), which cost 3 ticks. Now I only have the "leave" action available at the Explorers Guild.
  
  My strategy going forward:
  1. Leave and return to Town Square
  2. Explore other guilds to understand what skills they teach
  3. I need to figure out which skill to learn next - likely a gathering skill (Mining or Forestry) since I need resources to progress
  4. Eventually I'll want to explore beyond Town to discover new areas and resources
  
  Let me leave the Explorers Guild and return to Town Square.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Explorers Guild for Town Square

LEARNING:
  Enroling in a skill costs time (3 ticks in this case). I now have Exploration skill at Level 1, which might unlock new exploration options or reveal new areas.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Exploration L1
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

REASONING:
  Excellent! I'm back at Town Square and I can see something new has appeared - "Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)". This is a direct result of learning Exploration L1! My Exploration skill has revealed a new area connection.
  
  Current situation:
  - I have Exploration L1 which revealed Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
  - I still have no resources or tools
  - I need to decide my next steps
  
  Strategy:
  1. I should explore more guilds first to understand what resources I can gather
  2. Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is expensive - I should prepare before going
  3. I need to learn a gathering skill (Mining or Forestry) to actually collect resources
  4. The Smithing Guild might help me craft tools if I gather raw materials
  
  Let me go to the Miners Guild next to learn about mining and see if I can gather ore somewhere nearby.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_MINERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Miners Guild

LEARNING:
  Exploration skill reveals new area connections! Miner's Ridge is now visible and is 18 ticks away. This suggests that higher exploration levels might reveal even more areas.

=== TICK 6 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

REASONING:
  I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see:
  - An "enrol" option to learn the Mining skill
  - A contract available: "miners-guild-1" which exchanges 2 COPPER_BAR for 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation
  - A "leave" option
  
  The contract is interesting - it suggests that:
  1. COPPER_BAR and COPPER_ORE are resources in this game
  2. The guild does trades/contracts
  3. I need to gather or obtain copper bars first
  
  However, I should enrol in Mining first to actually be able to gather copper ore. This seems like the logical progression:
  1. Learn Mining skill
  2. Find ore nodes to gather from
  3. Collect copper ore
  4. Either use it or potentially trade it (if I can process it into bars)
  
  Let me enrol in Mining.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Mining"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Mining guild (3t)

LEARNING:
  Miners Guild offers:
  - Mining skill enrollment
  - Contract "miners-guild-1": Requires 2 COPPER_BAR → Gives 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 reputation
  This suggests copper is a major resource, with both ore and bar forms existing. Need to understand how to convert between them.

=== TICK 6 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)

REASONING:
  Great! I've successfully enrolled in Mining L1. I can see some important mechanics:
  
  1. Mining L1 has a [FOCUS] mode available - which means I can focus on specific materials
  2. At Mining L3, I'll unlock APPRAISE mode - a bonus unlock at higher levels
  3. The skill cost 3 ticks (same as Exploration)
  
  Now I need to:
  1. Leave the Miners Guild
  2. Find where to actually mine - likely at Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
  3. Gather copper ore to work toward contracts
  
  Since I have limited ticks in a session and Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, I should consider:
  - Going there to see what's available
  - Or exploring other guilds first to understand the full picture
  
  Let me leave and plan my next move.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Miners Guild for Town Square

LEARNING:
  Mining skill unlocks modes:
  - L1: FOCUS mode (gather specific materials)
  - L3: APPRAISE mode (bonus unlock)
  Skills cost 3 ticks to enrol.

=== TICK 6 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  Recipes: iron-bar (2 IRON_ORE, Smithing), copper-bar (2 COPPER_ORE, Smithing)
  
  Location: Smithing Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

REASONING:
  I'm back at Town Square with 6 ticks elapsed. I've learned Mining and Exploration skills. Now I need to decide:
  
  1. Should I explore more guilds to understand all available skills?
  2. Should I head to Miner's Ridge to start gathering?
  3. Should I check out the Smithing Guild since it might be relevant to processing resources?
  
  The problem is that Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is a significant investment. I should map out more of the world first to optimize my strategy.
  
  Let me visit the Smithing Guild next since:
  - It likely teaches how to craft/process resources
  - Understanding tool crafting might be crucial before I go mining
  - It's still in Town so it's free to explore

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_SMITHING_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Smithing Guild

LEARNING:
  Town Square is the hub where I can access all guilds and services. The Smithing Guild might reveal crafting recipes or tool requirements.

=== TICK 9 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  Recipes: iron-bar (2 IRON_ORE, Smithing), copper-bar (2 COPPER_ORE, Smithing)
  
  Location: Smithing Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

REASONING:
  Excellent discovery! The Smithing Guild reveals critical information:
  
  RECIPES DISCOVERED:
  - iron-bar: requires 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing skill
  - copper-bar: requires 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill
  
  This is crucial! It shows:
  1. I need to learn Smithing skill to craft bars from ore
  2. The miners-guild-1 contract (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE) makes sense now - it's a way to convert bars back to ore
  3. There are at least two ore types: COPPER_ORE and IRON_ORE
  4. The progression is: Mine ore → Craft into bars (using Smithing) → Use bars for contracts/resources
  
  Current strategy:
  1. I should enrol in Smithing to unlock bar crafting
  2. Then go to Miner's Ridge to gather ore
  3. Craft ore into bars
  4. Complete contracts to earn reputation
  
  Let me enrol in Smithing.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Smithing"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Smithing guild (3t)

LEARNING:
  Smithing skill unlocks crafting recipes! The recipes require specific ore types and the Smithing skill to execute. This is a core progression mechanic.

=== TICK 9 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)

REASONING:
  Good! I've now enrolled in Smithing L1. Current ticks: 9 out of my session budget.
  
  I now have:
  - Mining L1 (can gather ore with FOCUS mode)
  - Smithing L1 (can craft ore into bars)
  - Exploration L1 (reveals new areas)
  
  Next steps:
  1. Leave the Smithing Guild
  2. Head to Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away) to start gathering ore
  3. Gather copper ore and/or iron ore
  4. Return to craft bars
  5. Complete contracts for reputation
  
  I have enough ticks to make the journey (9 spent, so if I have ~100 ticks total, 18 ticks to Miner's Ridge is feasible). Let me leave and head there.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Smithing Guild for Town Square

LEARNING:
  Smithing is now learned. I can craft bars from ore. Time to go mining!

=== TICK 27 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

REASONING:
  I'm back at Town Square with 9 ticks spent. Now I need to head to Miner's Ridge to start gathering ore. The journey costs 18 ticks, which will bring me to T27.
  
  Let me think about my tick budget:
  - If sessions are typically 100-150 ticks, I'll have 73-141 ticks remaining after the journey
  - That should be enough to gather resources, craft bars, and complete some contracts
  
  Let me head to Miner's Ridge now.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"area-d1-i0"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Miner's Ridge (18t)

LEARNING:
  About to explore a new area. Expecting to find ore nodes that I can mine with my Mining L1 skill.

=== TICK 27 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

REASONING:
  Great! I've arrived at Miner's Ridge (T27). The location shows "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" - this means I need to use an exploration action to discover what's available here.
  
  I have Exploration L1, which should allow me to explore this area. However, I don't see an explicit "Explore" action listed in the action types available. Let me check what actions are available to me:
  
  Looking back at the action formats:
  - Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken
  
  The "explore action" might be accomplished through:
  1. Using Exploration skill somehow (not clear how)
  2. Moving around the area (Go to specific locations)
  3. A special action I haven't discovered yet
  
  Let me try going to what might be a location here, or I could try the Gather action to see if there are nodes available. Actually, thinking about it - I should try to discover locations by attempting to Go to common mining locations like "ore vein" or "copper vein".
  
  Let me try: Go to ore vein

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"ore vein"}

RESULT:
  ✗ No path to destination!

LEARNING:
  Arrived at Miner's Ridge but it's unexplored. Need to find the actual mining locations/nodes within this area.

=== TICK 27 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

REASONING:
  The Go action failed - "NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION". This tells me that:
  
  1. I can't just guess location names to go to
  2. The area is "unexplored" and I need to use an "explore action to start"
  3. The explore action must be something I haven't tried yet
  
  Looking at my available actions again:
  - Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken
  
  The hint says "use explore action" - but none of these are explicitly "Explore". However, I notice:
  - Exploration is a skill I have (L1)
  - Maybe exploration works differently than other skills
  - Perhaps I need to look for an action that uses my Exploration skill
  
  Wait - looking at the original action formats, I see:
  - Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE>
  
  But I don't know the node IDs yet. The "explore action" must reveal them.
  
  Let me try using a generic Gather or similar. Actually, re-reading: the game says "use explore action to start" - maybe this is a context-specific action that should appear if I'm at an unexplored location. Let me try the most logical action format:

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_EXPLORERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Unknown location!

LEARNING:
  The area is truly unexplored and requires a specific exploration action to reveal locations. Standard Go to <location> doesn't work here.

=== TICK 27 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

REASONING:
  Two failed attempts now. The game is telling me clearly: "use explore action to start". This suggests there's a specific action I need to use.
  
  Looking at the action list again more carefully:
  - Go: Travel to destinations
  - Leave: Return to hub/clearing from a location you've entered
  - Enrol: Learn a new skill
  - Gather: Extract resources from nodes
  - Fight: Battle enemies
  - Store: Put items in storage
  - Drop: Discard items
  - AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract
  - TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts
  
  None of these explicitly say "Explore". But wait - the game mechanics mention "You have an inventory with limited slots" and "You can learn skills and level them up through practice".
  
  Maybe the Exploration skill works by gathering information? Or maybe "Gather" with a specific mode or without parameters?
  
  Actually, re-reading the Gather action format:
  `Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]`
  
  But this requires a NODE_ID which I don't have because the area is unexplored.
  
  Let me think differently - perhaps the exploration action is implicit in the Go command but with a special syntax. Or maybe I need to just try "Gather" without parameters to trigger exploration?
  
  Let me try the simplest approach - just attempt to Gather with a generic node identifier:

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"exploration","mode":"APPRAISE"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Resource node not found!

LEARNING:
  The exploration action mechanism isn't obvious from the action formats given. Need to discover the correct syntax.

=== TICK 27 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

REASONING:
  The gather action also failed. I'm stuck at an unexplored location and can't figure out the syntax for the "explore action".
  
  Let me reconsider what I know:
  - The location says "Unexplored (use explore action to start)"
  - I have Exploration L1 skill
  - None of the listed action types explicitly mention "Explore"
  - Go, Gather, Fight all failed
  
  Wait - maybe the exploration action is a special action that only becomes available at unexplored locations, and I should just describe what I want to do naturally. But that doesn't match the format requirement.
  
  Actually, let me re-read the action formats more carefully. Under the "Go" action:
  "Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
    - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
    - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)"
  
  The phrase "Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)" suggests I only see areas I've already discovered. But it also says at Miner's Ridge there are "Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town" - nothing else listed.
  
  Maybe I need to try going to a generic mining location type name. Let me try variations:

ACTION: (no action)

RESULT:
  (no result)

LEARNING:
  Still struggling with the exploration mechanic. The "explore action" hint suggests there's a specific way to reveal the area's contents that I haven't discovered yet.

=== TICK 97 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

REASONING:
  The system didn't show a result for my last action - it just re-displayed the current state. This is unusual. Let me think about what "explore action" could mean.
  
  Looking back at the instructions, it says actions should be formatted precisely. The message says "use explore action to start" - this is a game message hinting at what I should do.
  
  Perhaps "explore action" isn't a standard action type, but rather a special command. Let me try variations on the word "explore":
  - Maybe it's just: "Explore"
  - Or: "Explore Miner's Ridge"
  - Or: "Go to explore" (already tried, failed)
  
  Actually, I just realized - the system message might be telling me to use my Exploration skill. Maybe there's an action format I haven't tried. Let me look at skill usage patterns:
  - Mining is used with Gather
  - Smithing might be used with a crafting action
  - Exploration might need its own action type
  
  Let me try the simplest possible command:

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Greenhold Slopes (36t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (24 to next level, 4% there)
    RNG: average (45% percentile) - took 70t, 10t faster than expected

LEARNING:
  The exploration mechanic remains mysterious. The game explicitly says "use explore action to start" but this action type isn't in the provided format list.

=== TICK 139 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

REASONING:
  Excellent! The "Explore" action worked! It:
  1. Cost some time (not shown explicitly but we're still at T27, so likely minimal cost or 0 ticks)
  2. Gave me +1 Exploration XP
  3. Revealed a new connection: Greenhold Slopes at 36 ticks away (undiscovered)
  
  The area is STILL showing as "Unexplored" though, which means there's more to discover here. I need to keep exploring or find the actual mining nodes. Let me continue exploring to reveal the locations within Miner's Ridge itself.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered ore vein (42t)
    +1 Exploration XP (23 to next level, 8% there)
    RNG: average (52% percentile) - took 42t, 2t slower than expected

LEARNING:
  The "Explore" action (without parameters) works! It reveals new area connections and grants Exploration XP. The Explore action appears to have minimal or zero time cost. Need to keep exploring to reveal the actual nodes/locations within Miner's Ridge.

=== TICK 139 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

REASONING:
  Excellent progress! The second Explore action revealed the actual gathering locations:
  - Ore vein with Copper Ore (available now) and Tin Ore (requires L2 Mining)
  
  The area now shows "Partly explored" instead of "Unexplored", and I can see a gathering node. The CONTINUE_IF condition is no longer met since it's now "Partly explored" not "Unexplored".
  
  Now I should gather resources. I have Mining L1 with FOCUS mode available. I should:
  1. Go to the ore vein
  2. Gather copper ore using FOCUS mode (since I know the material ID)
  
  Let me go to the ore vein first.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"ore vein"}

RESULT:
  ✗ No path to destination!

LEARNING:
  The Explore action revealed gathering locations within the area. After 2 explores, Miner's Ridge shows "Partly explored" with an ore vein containing Copper Ore and Tin Ore (L2 locked).

=== TICK 139 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

REASONING:
  The "Go to ore vein" command failed with "NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION". This is the same error I got before when trying to navigate.
  
  Looking at the location display, it shows:
  - "Gathering: Ore vein - ..."
  
  This is listed as a section at the current location, not as a separate destination to travel to. The ore vein appears to be accessible from where I am now, not through a "Go" command.
  
  I think the ore vein is right here at Miner's Ridge, and I should use the Gather action directly on it. The node ID is likely "ore vein" or similar. Let me try gathering from the ore vein using FOCUS mode on COPPER_ORE.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"ore-vein","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"COPPER_ORE"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Resource node not found!

LEARNING:
  Locations within an area (like ore veins) cannot be accessed via "Go" command. They're available directly from the parent location and should be gathered from using the Gather action.

=== TICK 139 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

REASONING:
  The node ID "ore-vein" doesn't exist. The display shows "Ore vein" with a capital O and a space. Let me try different formatting:
  - "Ore vein" (with capital and space)
  - "ore vein" (lowercase with space)
  
  The format requires: Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  
  Let me try with the exact text shown in the interface.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"node"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Resource node not found!

LEARNING:
  Node ID naming convention unclear - "ore-vein" failed, trying the displayed name format instead.

=== TICK 207 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Miner's Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)
  Connections further from Town: 30t - Stone Vein Ridge (undiscovered)

REASONING:
  Both "ore-vein" and "Ore vein" failed. The system is showing "undefined" for the node ID, which suggests the parser isn't recognizing my format.
  
  Looking back at the action format: "Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]"
  
  Maybe I need to explore more to get the actual node ID. The area shows "Partly explored" - perhaps I need to continue exploring to fully reveal the node IDs. Let me try exploring again.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Stone Vein Ridge (30t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (22 to next level, 12% there)
    RNG: average (44% percentile) - took 68t, 12t faster than expected

LEARNING:
  Node IDs aren't revealed by just seeing "Ore vein" listed. Need to continue exploring to get proper node identifiers.
