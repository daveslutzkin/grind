--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]

- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none

Location: Town Square in TOWN

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections: none known

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm starting a text-based resource gathering game. I have no inventory, no skills, and I'm in the Town Square. My goal is to have fun while exploring this world.

Looking at my options:
- There are 6 guilds available (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers)
- There's a Warehouse service
- I have no known connections to other areas yet

My strategy:
1. First, I should explore the guilds to understand what skills are available
2. The Explorers Guild seems like a good starting point - it might teach me about exploration and discovering new areas
3. Alternatively, I could start with a practical gathering skill like Miners or Foresters
4. Combat Guild requires a weapon, which I'd need to obtain first

I'll start by visiting the Explorers Guild to learn what that skill offers, as exploration seems foundational to discovering the world and understanding the game better.

ACTION: Go to Explorers Guild

LEARNING: Starting fresh - need to understand guild structure, available skills, and how to gather resources efficiently.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (likely teaches Mining skill)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)
- Smithing Guild (likely makes weapons/tools)
- Woodcrafters Guild (likely crafts wood items)
- Explorers Guild (likely teaches exploration/discovery)

Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Excellent! I'm back at Town Square and I can see something new has appeared - "Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)". This is a direct result of learning Exploration L1! My Exploration skill has revealed a new area connection.

Current situation:
- I have Exploration L1 which revealed Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
- I still have no resources or tools
- I need to decide my next steps

Strategy:
1. I should explore more guilds first to understand what resources I can gather
2. Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is expensive - I should prepare before going
3. I need to learn a gathering skill (Mining or Forestry) to actually collect resources
4. The Smithing Guild might help me craft tools if I gather raw materials

Let me go to the Miners Guild next to learn about mining and see if I can gather ore somewhere nearby.

ACTION: Go to Miners Guild

LEARNING: Exploration skill reveals new area connections! Miner's Ridge is now visible and is 18 ticks away. This suggests that higher exploration levels might reveal even more areas.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

--- RECENT MESSAGES (Full Detail) ---
[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none

Location: Town Square in TOWN

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections: none known

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm starting a text-based resource gathering game. I have no inventory, no skills, and I'm in the Town Square. My goal is to have fun while exploring this world.

Looking at my options:
- There are 6 guilds available (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers)
- There's a Warehouse service
- I have no known connections to other areas yet

My strategy:
1. First, I should explore the guilds to understand what skills are available
2. The Explorers Guild seems like a good starting point - it might teach me about exploration and discovering new areas
3. Alternatively, I could start with a practical gathering skill like Miners or Foresters
4. Combat Guild requires a weapon, which I'd need to obtain first

I'll start by visiting the Explorers Guild to learn what that skill offers, as exploration seems foundational to discovering the world and understanding the game better.

ACTION: Go to Explorers Guild

LEARNING: Starting fresh - need to understand guild structure, available skills, and how to gather resources efficiently.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (likely teaches Mining skill)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)
- Smithing Guild (likely makes weapons/tools)
- Woodcrafters Guild (likely crafts wood items)
- Explorers Guild (likely teaches exploration/discovery)
SERVICES:
- Warehouse (storage facility)
STARTING INVENTORY: 0/20 slots, no skills

[user]: Result: T0: TravelToLocation → OK

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none

Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at the Explorers Guild. The action options are "enrol" (to learn the Exploration skill) or "leave" (to go back to Town Square).

Since I'm here and exploration seems like a good foundational skill to discover new areas and connections beyond the Town, I should enrol in the Exploration skill. This will likely help me:
1. Discover new areas and locations
2. Understand travel connections better
3. Open up new resource gathering opportunities

Let me enrol in Exploration.

ACTION: Enrol Exploration

LEARNING: Explorers Guild offers an Exploration skill that can be enrolled. This is likely a key skill for discovering new areas and connections.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (likely teaches Mining skill)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)
- Smithing Guild (likely makes weapons/tools)
- Woodcrafters Guild (likely crafts wood items)
- Explorers Guild (likely teaches exploration/discovery) - SKILL AVAILABLE: Exploration

STARTING INVENTORY: 0/20 slots, no skills

[user]: Result: T0: Enrol Exploration → 3t

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Exploration L1

Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I've successfully enrolled in Exploration skill (Level 1), which cost 3 ticks. Now I only have the "leave" action available at the Explorers Guild.

My strategy going forward:
1. Leave and return to Town Square
2. Explore other guilds to understand what skills they teach
3. I need to figure out which skill to learn next - likely a gathering skill (Mining or Forestry) since I need resources to progress
4. Eventually I'll want to explore beyond Town to discover new areas and resources

Let me leave the Explorers Guild and return to Town Square.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Enroling in a skill costs time (3 ticks in this case). I now have Exploration skill at Level 1, which might unlock new exploration options or reveal new areas.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (likely teaches Mining skill)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)
- Smithing Guild (likely makes weapons/tools)
- Woodcrafters Guild (likely crafts wood items)
- Explorers Guild (teaches Exploration skill) - ENROLLED: Exploration L1

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! I'm back at Town Square and I can see something new has appeared - "Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)". This is a direct result of learning Exploration L1! My Exploration skill has revealed a new area connection.

Current situation:
- I have Exploration L1 which revealed Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
- I still have no resources or tools
- I need to decide my next steps

Strategy:
1. I should explore more guilds first to understand what resources I can gather
2. Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is expensive - I should prepare before going
3. I need to learn a gathering skill (Mining or Forestry) to actually collect resources
4. The Smithing Guild might help me craft tools if I gather raw materials

Let me go to the Miners Guild next to learn about mining and see if I can gather ore somewhere nearby.

ACTION: Go to Miners Guild

LEARNING: Exploration skill reveals new area connections! Miner's Ridge is now visible and is 18 ticks away. This suggests that higher exploration levels might reveal even more areas.

NOTES:

--- CURRENT PROMPT ---
Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Exploration L1
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see:
- An "enrol" option to learn the Mining skill
- A contract available: "miners-guild-1" which exchanges 2 COPPER_BAR for 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation
- A "leave" option

The contract is interesting - it suggests that:
1. COPPER_BAR and COPPER_ORE are resources in this game
2. The guild does trades/contracts
3. I need to gather or obtain copper bars first

However, I should enrol in Mining first to actually be able to gather copper ore. This seems like the logical progression:
1. Learn Mining skill
2. Find ore nodes to gather from
3. Collect copper ore
4. Either use it or potentially trade it (if I can process it into bars)

Let me enrol in Mining.

ACTION: Enrol Mining

LEARNING: Miners Guild offers:
- Mining skill enrollment
- Contract "miners-guild-1": Requires 2 COPPER_BAR → Gives 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 reputation
This suggests copper is a major resource, with both ore and bar forms existing. Need to understand how to convert between them.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (teaches Mining skill) - Contract: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none

Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at the Explorers Guild. The action options are "enrol" (to learn the Exploration skill) or "leave" (to go back to Town Square).

Since I'm here and exploration seems like a good foundational skill to discover new areas and connections beyond the Town, I should enrol in the Exploration skill. This will likely help me:
1. Discover new areas and locations
2. Understand travel connections better
3. Open up new resource gathering opportunities

Let me enrol in Exploration.

ACTION: Enrol Exploration

LEARNING: Explorers Guild offers an Exploration skill that can be enrolled. This is likely a key skill for discovering new areas and connections.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (likely teaches Mining skill)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)
- Smithing Guild (likely makes weapons/tools)
- Woodcrafters Guild (likely crafts wood items)
- Explorers Guild (likely teaches exploration/discovery) - SKILL AVAILABLE: Exploration

SERVICES:
- Warehouse (storage facility)

STARTING INVENTORY: 0/20 slots, no skills

[user]: Result: T0: Enrol Exploration → 3t

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Exploration L1

Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I've successfully enrolled in Exploration skill (Level 1), which cost 3 ticks. Now I only have the "leave" action available at the Explorers Guild.

My strategy going forward:
1. Leave and return to Town Square
2. Explore other guilds to understand what skills they teach
3. I need to figure out which skill to learn next - likely a gathering skill (Mining or Forestry) since I need resources to progress
4. Eventually I'll want to explore beyond Town to discover new areas and resources

Let me leave the Explorers Guild and return to Town Square.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Enroling in a skill costs time (3 ticks in this case). I now have Exploration skill at Level 1, which might unlock new exploration options or reveal new areas.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (likely teaches Mining skill)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)

[user]: Result: T3: Leave → OK

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Exploration L1

Location: Town Square in TOWN

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! I'm back at Town Square and I can see something new has appeared - "Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)". This is a direct result of learning Exploration L1! My Exploration skill has revealed a new area connection.

Current situation:
- I have Exploration L1 which revealed Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
- I still have no resources or tools
- I need to decide my next steps

Strategy:
1. I should explore more guilds first to understand what resources I can gather
2. Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is expensive - I should prepare before going
3. I need to learn a gathering skill (Mining or Forestry) to actually collect resources
4. The Smithing Guild might help me craft tools if I gather raw materials

Let me go to the Miners Guild next to learn about mining and see if I can gather ore somewhere nearby.

ACTION: Go to Miners Guild

LEARNING: Exploration skill reveals new area connections! Miner's Ridge is now visible and is 18 ticks away. This suggests that higher exploration levels might reveal even more areas.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (likely teaches Mining skill)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Exploration L1
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see:
- An "enrol" option to learn the Mining skill
- A contract available: "miners-guild-1" which exchanges 2 COPPER_BAR for 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation
- A "leave" option

The contract is interesting - it suggests that:
1. COPPER_BAR and COPPER_ORE are resources in this game
2. The guild does trades/contracts
3. I need to gather or obtain copper bars first

However, I should enrol in Mining first to actually be able to gather copper ore. This seems like the logical progression:
1. Learn Mining skill
2. Find ore nodes to gather from
3. Collect copper ore
4. Either use it or potentially trade it (if I can process it into bars)

Let me enrol in Mining.

ACTION: Enrol Mining

LEARNING: Miners Guild offers:
- Mining skill enrollment
- Contract "miners-guild-1": Requires 2 COPPER_BAR → Gives 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 reputation
This suggests copper is a major resource, with both ore and bar forms existing. Need to understand how to convert between them.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (teaches Mining skill) - Contract: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)
- Smithing Guild (likely makes weapons/tools)

Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I've successfully enrolled in Mining L1. I can see some important mechanics:

1. Mining L1 has a [FOCUS] mode available - which means I can focus on specific materials
2. At Mining L3, I'll unlock APPRAISE mode - a bonus unlock at higher levels
3. The skill cost 3 ticks (same as Exploration)

Now I need to:
1. Leave the Miners Guild
2. Find where to actually mine - likely at Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
3. Gather copper ore to work toward contracts

Since I have limited ticks in a session and Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, I should consider:
- Going there to see what's available
- Or exploring other guilds first to understand the full picture

Let me leave and plan my next move.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Mining skill unlocks modes:
- L1: FOCUS mode (gather specific materials)
- L3: APPRAISE mode (bonus unlock)
Skills cost 3 ticks to enrol.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm back at Town Square with 6 ticks elapsed. I've learned Mining and Exploration skills. Now I need to decide:

1. Should I explore more guilds to understand all available skills?
2. Should I head to Miner's Ridge to start gathering?
3. Should I check out the Smithing Guild since it might be relevant to processing resources?

The problem is that Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is a significant investment. I should map out more of the world first to optimize my strategy.

Let me visit the Smithing Guild next since:
- It likely teaches how to craft/process resources
- Understanding tool crafting might be crucial before I go mining
- It's still in Town so it's free to explore

ACTION: Go to Smithing Guild

LEARNING: Town Square is the hub where I can access all guilds and services. The Smithing Guild might reveal crafting recipes or tool requirements.

Location: Smithing Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Excellent discovery! The Smithing Guild reveals critical information:

RECIPES DISCOVERED:
- iron-bar: requires 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing skill
- copper-bar: requires 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill

This is crucial! It shows:
1. I need to learn Smithing skill to craft bars from ore
2. The miners-guild-1 contract (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE) makes sense now - it's a way to convert bars back to ore
3. There are at least two ore types: COPPER_ORE and IRON_ORE
4. The progression is: Mine ore → Craft into bars (using Smithing) → Use bars for contracts/resources

Current strategy:
1. I should enrol in Smithing to unlock bar crafting
2. Then go to Miner's Ridge to gather ore
3. Craft ore into bars
4. Complete contracts to earn reputation

Let me enrol in Smithing.

ACTION: Enrol Smithing

LEARNING: Smithing skill unlocks crafting recipes! The recipes require specific ore types and the Smithing skill to execute. This is a core progression mechanic.

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Exploration L1

Location: Town Square in TOWN

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! I'm back at Town Square and I can see something new has appeared - "Connections further from Town: 18t - Miner's Ridge (unexplored)". This is a direct result of learning Exploration L1! My Exploration skill has revealed a new area connection.

Current situation:
- I have Exploration L1 which revealed Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
- I still have no resources or tools
- I need to decide my next steps

Strategy:
1. I should explore more guilds first to understand what resources I can gather
2. Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is expensive - I should prepare before going
3. I need to learn a gathering skill (Mining or Forestry) to actually collect resources
4. The Smithing Guild might help me craft tools if I gather raw materials

Let me go to the Miners Guild next to learn about mining and see if I can gather ore somewhere nearby.

ACTION: Go to Miners Guild

LEARNING: Exploration skill reveals new area connections! Miner's Ridge is now visible and is 18 ticks away. This suggests that higher exploration levels might reveal even more areas.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (likely teaches Mining skill)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)
- Combat Guild (likely teaches Combat skill, may need weapon)
- Smithing Guild (likely makes weapons/tools)

[user]: Result: T3: TravelToLocation → OK

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Exploration L1
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see:
- An "enrol" option to learn the Mining skill
- A contract available: "miners-guild-1" which exchanges 2 COPPER_BAR for 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation
- A "leave" option

The contract is interesting - it suggests that:
1. COPPER_BAR and COPPER_ORE are resources in this game
2. The guild does trades/contracts
3. I need to gather or obtain copper bars first

However, I should enrol in Mining first to actually be able to gather copper ore. This seems like the logical progression:
1. Learn Mining skill
2. Find ore nodes to gather from
3. Collect copper ore
4. Either use it or potentially trade it (if I can process it into bars)

Let me enrol in Mining.

ACTION: Enrol Mining

LEARNING: Miners Guild offers:
- Mining skill enrollment
- Contract "miners-guild-1": Requires 2 COPPER_BAR → Gives 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 reputation
This suggests copper is a major resource, with both ore and bar forms existing. Need to understand how to convert between them.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (teaches Mining skill) - Contract: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
- Foresters Guild (likely teaches Forestry skill)

Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I've successfully enrolled in Mining L1. I can see some important mechanics:

1. Mining L1 has a [FOCUS] mode available - which means I can focus on specific materials
2. At Mining L3, I'll unlock APPRAISE mode - a bonus unlock at higher levels
3. The skill cost 3 ticks (same as Exploration)

Now I need to:
1. Leave the Miners Guild
2. Find where to actually mine - likely at Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
3. Gather copper ore to work toward contracts

Since I have limited ticks in a session and Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, I should consider:
- Going there to see what's available
- Or exploring other guilds first to understand the full picture

Let me leave and plan my next move.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Mining skill unlocks modes:
- L1: FOCUS mode (gather specific materials)
- L3: APPRAISE mode (bonus unlock)
Skills cost 3 ticks to enrol.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm back at Town Square with 6 ticks elapsed. I've learned Mining and Exploration skills. Now I need to decide:

1. Should I explore more guilds to understand all available skills?
2. Should I head to Miner's Ridge to start gathering?
3. Should I check out the Smithing Guild since it might be relevant to processing resources?

The problem is that Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is a significant investment. I should map out more of the world first to optimize my strategy.

Let me visit the Smithing Guild next since:
- It likely teaches how to craft/process resources
- Understanding tool crafting might be crucial before I go mining
- It's still in Town so it's free to explore

ACTION: Go to Smithing Guild

LEARNING: Town Square is the hub where I can access all guilds and services. The Smithing Guild might reveal crafting recipes or tool requirements.

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent discovery! The Smithing Guild reveals critical information:

RECIPES DISCOVERED:
- iron-bar: requires 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing skill
- copper-bar: requires 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill

This is crucial! It shows:
1. I need to learn Smithing skill to craft bars from ore
2. The miners-guild-1 contract (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE) makes sense now - it's a way to convert bars back to ore
3. There are at least two ore types: COPPER_ORE and IRON_ORE
4. The progression is: Mine ore → Craft into bars (using Smithing) → Use bars for contracts/resources

Current strategy:
1. I should enrol in Smithing to unlock bar crafting
2. Then go to Miner's Ridge to gather ore
3. Craft ore into bars
4. Complete contracts to earn reputation

Let me enrol in Smithing.

ACTION: Enrol Smithing

LEARNING: Smithing skill unlocks crafting recipes! The recipes require specific ore types and the Smithing skill to execute. This is a core progression mechanic.

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.

REASONING: I'm back at Town Square with 9 ticks spent. Now I need to head to Miner's Ridge to start gathering ore. The journey costs 18 ticks, which will bring me to T27.

Let me think about my tick budget:
- If sessions are typically 100-150 ticks, I'll have 73-141 ticks remaining after the journey
- That should be enough to gather resources, craft bars, and complete some contracts

Let me head to Miner's Ridge now.

ACTION: Go to Miner's Ridge

LEARNING: About to explore a new area. Expecting to find ore nodes that I can mine with my Mining L1 skill.

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I've successfully enrolled in Mining L1. I can see some important mechanics:

1. Mining L1 has a [FOCUS] mode available - which means I can focus on specific materials
2. At Mining L3, I'll unlock APPRAISE mode - a bonus unlock at higher levels
3. The skill cost 3 ticks (same as Exploration)

Now I need to:
1. Leave the Miners Guild
2. Find where to actually mine - likely at Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away)
3. Gather copper ore to work toward contracts

Since I have limited ticks in a session and Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, I should consider:
- Going there to see what's available
- Or exploring other guilds first to understand the full picture

Let me leave and plan my next move.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Mining skill unlocks modes:
- L1: FOCUS mode (gather specific materials)
- L3: APPRAISE mode (bonus unlock)
Skills cost 3 ticks to enrol.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm back at Town Square with 6 ticks elapsed. I've learned Mining and Exploration skills. Now I need to decide:

1. Should I explore more guilds to understand all available skills?
2. Should I head to Miner's Ridge to start gathering?
3. Should I check out the Smithing Guild since it might be relevant to processing resources?

The problem is that Miner's Ridge is 18 ticks away, which is a significant investment. I should map out more of the world first to optimize my strategy.

Let me visit the Smithing Guild next since:
- It likely teaches how to craft/process resources
- Understanding tool crafting might be crucial before I go mining
- It's still in Town so it's free to explore

ACTION: Go to Smithing Guild

LEARNING: Town Square is the hub where I can access all guilds and services. The Smithing Guild might reveal crafting recipes or tool requirements.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent discovery! The Smithing Guild reveals critical information:

RECIPES DISCOVERED:
- iron-bar: requires 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing skill
- copper-bar: requires 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill

This is crucial! It shows:
1. I need to learn Smithing skill to craft bars from ore
2. The miners-guild-1 contract (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE) makes sense now - it's a way to convert bars back to ore
3. There are at least two ore types: COPPER_ORE and IRON_ORE
4. The progression is: Mine ore → Craft into bars (using Smithing) → Use bars for contracts/resources

Current strategy:
1. I should enrol in Smithing to unlock bar crafting
2. Then go to Miner's Ridge to gather ore
3. Craft ore into bars
4. Complete contracts to earn reputation

Let me enrol in Smithing.

ACTION: Enrol Smithing

LEARNING: Smithing skill unlocks crafting recipes! The recipes require specific ore types and the Smithing skill to execute. This is a core progression mechanic.

I now have:
- Mining L1 (can gather ore with FOCUS mode)
- Smithing L1 (can craft ore into bars)
- Exploration L1 (reveals new areas)

Next steps:
1. Leave the Smithing Guild
2. Head to Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away) to start gathering ore
3. Gather copper ore and/or iron ore
4. Return to craft bars
5. Complete contracts for reputation

I have enough ticks to make the journey (9 spent, so if I have ~100 ticks total, 18 ticks to Miner's Ridge is feasible). Let me leave and head there.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Great! I've arrived at Miner's Ridge (T27). The location shows "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" - this means I need to use an exploration action to discover what's available here.

I have Exploration L1, which should allow me to explore this area. However, I don't see an explicit "Explore" action listed in the action types available. Let me check what actions are available to me:

Looking back at the action formats:
- Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken

The "explore action" might be accomplished through:
1. Using Exploration skill somehow (not clear how)
2. Moving around the area (Go to specific locations)
3. A special action I haven't discovered yet

Let me try going to what might be a location here, or I could try the Gather action to see if there are nodes available. Actually, thinking about it - I should try to discover locations by attempting to Go to common mining locations like "ore vein" or "copper vein".

Let me try: Go to ore vein

ACTION: Go to ore vein

LEARNING: Arrived at Miner's Ridge but it's unexplored. Need to find the actual mining locations/nodes within this area.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm back at Town Square with 9 ticks spent. Now I need to head to Miner's Ridge to start gathering ore. The journey costs 18 ticks, which will bring me to T27.

Let me think about my tick budget:
- If sessions are typically 100-150 ticks, I'll have 73-141 ticks remaining after the journey
- That should be enough to gather resources, craft bars, and complete some contracts

Let me head to Miner's Ridge now.

ACTION: Go to Miner's Ridge

LEARNING: About to explore a new area. Expecting to find ore nodes that I can mine with my Mining L1 skill.

NOTES: 
GUILDS IN TOWN:
- Miners Guild (teaches Mining skill) - Contract: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I've arrived at Miner's Ridge (T27). The location shows "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" - this means I need to use an exploration action to discover what's available here.

I have Exploration L1, which should allow me to explore this area. However, I don't see an explicit "Explore" action listed in the action types available. Let me check what actions are available to me:

Looking back at the action formats:
- Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken

The "explore action" might be accomplished through:
1. Using Exploration skill somehow (not clear how)
2. Moving around the area (Go to specific locations)
3. A special action I haven't discovered yet

Let me try going to what might be a location here, or I could try the Gather action to see if there are nodes available. Actually, thinking about it - I should try to discover locations by attempting to Go to common mining locations like "ore vein" or "copper vein".

Let me try: Go to ore vein

ACTION: Go to ore vein

LEARNING: Arrived at Miner's Ridge but it's unexplored. Need to find the actual mining locations/nodes within this area.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: The Go action failed - "NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION". This tells me that:

1. I can't just guess location names to go to
2. The area is "unexplored" and I need to use an "explore action to start"
3. The explore action must be something I haven't tried yet

Looking at my available actions again:
- Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken

The hint says "use explore action" - but none of these are explicitly "Explore". However, I notice:
- Exploration is a skill I have (L1)
- Maybe exploration works differently than other skills
- Perhaps I need to look for an action that uses my Exploration skill

Wait - looking at the original action formats, I see:
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE>

But I don't know the node IDs yet. The "explore action" must reveal them.

Let me try using a generic Gather or similar. Actually, re-reading: the game says "use explore action to start" - maybe this is a context-specific action that should appear if I'm at an unexplored location. Let me try the most logical action format:

ACTION: Go to explore

LEARNING: The area is truly unexplored and requires a specific exploration action to reveal locations. Standard Go to <location> doesn't work here.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
Recipes: iron-bar (2 IRON_ORE, Smithing), copper-bar (2 COPPER_ORE, Smithing)

Location: Smithing Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent discovery! The Smithing Guild reveals critical information:

RECIPES DISCOVERED:
- iron-bar: requires 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing skill
- copper-bar: requires 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill

This is crucial! It shows:
1. I need to learn Smithing skill to craft bars from ore
2. The miners-guild-1 contract (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE) makes sense now - it's a way to convert bars back to ore
3. There are at least two ore types: COPPER_ORE and IRON_ORE
4. The progression is: Mine ore → Craft into bars (using Smithing) → Use bars for contracts/resources

Current strategy:
1. I should enrol in Smithing to unlock bar crafting
2. Then go to Miner's Ridge to gather ore
3. Craft ore into bars
4. Complete contracts to earn reputation

Let me enrol in Smithing.

ACTION: Enrol Smithing

LEARNING: Smithing skill unlocks crafting recipes! The recipes require specific ore types and the Smithing skill to execute. This is a core progression mechanic.

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Good! I've now enrolled in Smithing L1. Current ticks: 9 out of my session budget.

I now have:
- Mining L1 (can gather ore with FOCUS mode)
- Smithing L1 (can craft ore into bars)
- Exploration L1 (reveals new areas)

Next steps:
1. Leave the Smithing Guild
2. Head to Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away) to start gathering ore
3. Gather copper ore and/or iron ore
4. Return to craft bars
5. Complete contracts for reputation

I have enough ticks to make the journey (9 spent, so if I have ~100 ticks total, 18 ticks to Miner's Ridge is feasible). Let me leave and head there.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Smithing is now learned. I can craft bars from ore. Time to go mining!

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Two failed attempts now. The game is telling me clearly: "use explore action to start". This suggests there's a specific action I need to use.

Looking at the action list again more carefully:
- Go: Travel to destinations
- Leave: Return to hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes
- Fight: Battle enemies
- Store: Put items in storage
- Drop: Discard items
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

None of these explicitly say "Explore". But wait - the game mechanics mention "You have an inventory with limited slots" and "You can learn skills and level them up through practice".

Maybe the Exploration skill works by gathering information? Or maybe "Gather" with a specific mode or without parameters?

Actually, re-reading the Gather action format:
`Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]`

But this requires a NODE_ID which I don't have because the area is unexplored.

Let me think differently - perhaps the exploration action is implicit in the Go command but with a special syntax. Or maybe I need to just try "Gather" without parameters to trigger exploration?

Let me try the simplest approach - just attempt to Gather with a generic node identifier:

ACTION: Gather node exploration APPRAISE

LEARNING: The exploration action mechanism isn't obvious from the action formats given. Need to discover the correct syntax.

[assistant]: REASONING: Good! I've now enrolled in Smithing L1. Current ticks: 9 out of my session budget.

I now have:
- Mining L1 (can gather ore with FOCUS mode)
- Smithing L1 (can craft ore into bars)
- Exploration L1 (reveals new areas)

Next steps:
1. Leave the Smithing Guild
2. Head to Miner's Ridge (18 ticks away) to start gathering ore
3. Gather copper ore and/or iron ore
4. Return to craft bars
5. Complete contracts for reputation

I have enough ticks to make the journey (9 spent, so if I have ~100 ticks total, 18 ticks to Miner's Ridge is feasible). Let me leave and head there.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Smithing is now learned. I can craft bars from ore. Time to go mining!

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm back at Town Square with 9 ticks spent. Now I need to head to Miner's Ridge to start gathering ore. The journey costs 18 ticks, which will bring me to T27.

Let me think about my tick budget:
- If sessions are typically 100-150 ticks, I'll have 73-141 ticks remaining after the journey
- That should be enough to gather resources, craft bars, and complete some contracts

Let me head to Miner's Ridge now.

ACTION: Go to Miner's Ridge

LEARNING: About to explore a new area. Expecting to find ore nodes that I can mine with my Mining L1 skill.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I've arrived at Miner's Ridge (T27). The location shows "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" - this means I need to use an exploration action to discover what's available here.

I have Exploration L1, which should allow me to explore this area. However, I don't see an explicit "Explore" action listed in the action types available. Let me check what actions are available to me:

Looking back at the action formats:
- Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken

The "explore action" might be accomplished through:
1. Using Exploration skill somehow (not clear how)
2. Moving around the area (Go to specific locations)
3. A special action I haven't discovered yet

Let me try going to what might be a location here, or I could try the Gather action to see if there are nodes available. Actually, thinking about it - I should try to discover locations by attempting to Go to common mining locations like "ore vein" or "copper vein".

Let me try: Go to ore vein

ACTION: Go to ore vein

LEARNING: Arrived at Miner's Ridge but it's unexplored. Need to find the actual mining locations/nodes within this area.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: The Go action failed - "NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION". This tells me that:

1. I can't just guess location names to go to
2. The area is "unexplored" and I need to use an "explore action to start"
3. The explore action must be something I haven't tried yet

Looking at my available actions again:
- Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken

The hint says "use explore action" - but none of these are explicitly "Explore". However, I notice:
- Exploration is a skill I have (L1)
- Maybe exploration works differently than other skills
- Perhaps I need to look for an action that uses my Exploration skill

Wait - looking at the original action formats, I see:
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE>

But I don't know the node IDs yet. The "explore action" must reveal them.

Let me try using a generic Gather or similar. Actually, re-reading: the game says "use explore action to start" - maybe this is a context-specific action that should appear if I'm at an unexplored location. Let me try the most logical action format:

ACTION: Go to explore

LEARNING: The area is truly unexplored and requires a specific exploration action to reveal locations. Standard Go to <location> doesn't work here.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: Two failed attempts now. The game is telling me clearly: "use explore action to start". This suggests there's a specific action I need to use.

Looking at the action list again more carefully:
- Go: Travel to destinations
- Leave: Return to hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes
- Fight: Battle enemies
- Store: Put items in storage
- Drop: Discard items
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

None of these explicitly say "Explore". But wait - the game mechanics mention "You have an inventory with limited slots" and "You can learn skills and level them up through practice".

Maybe the Exploration skill works by gathering information? Or maybe "Gather" with a specific mode or without parameters?

Actually, re-reading the Gather action format:
`Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]`

But this requires a NODE_ID which I don't have because the area is unexplored.

Let me think differently - perhaps the exploration action is implicit in the Go command but with a special syntax. Or maybe I need to just try "Gather" without parameters to trigger exploration?

Let me try the simplest approach - just attempt to Gather with a generic node identifier:

ACTION: Gather node exploration APPRAISE

LEARNING: The exploration action mechanism isn't obvious from the action formats given. Need to discover the correct syntax.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: The gather action also failed. I'm stuck at an unexplored location and can't figure out the syntax for the "explore action".

Let me reconsider what I know:
- The location says "Unexplored (use explore action to start)"
- I have Exploration L1 skill
- None of the listed action types explicitly mention "Explore"
- Go, Gather, Fight all failed

Wait - maybe the exploration action is a special action that only becomes available at unexplored locations, and I should just describe what I want to do naturally. But that doesn't match the format requirement.

Actually, let me re-read the action formats more carefully. Under the "Go" action:
"Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)"

The phrase "Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)" suggests I only see areas I've already discovered. But it also says at Miner's Ridge there are "Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town" - nothing else listed.

Maybe I need to try going to a generic mining location type name. Let me try variations:

ACTION: Go to copper vein

LEARNING: Still struggling with the exploration mechanic. The "explore action" hint suggests there's a specific way to reveal the area's contents that I haven't discovered yet.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

REASONING: The system didn't show a result for my last action - it just re-displayed the current state. This is unusual. Let me think about what "explore action" could mean.

Looking back at the instructions, it says actions should be formatted precisely. The message says "use explore action to start" - this is a game message hinting at what I should do.

Perhaps "explore action" isn't a standard action type, but rather a special command. Let me try variations on the word "explore":
- Maybe it's just: "Explore"
- Or: "Explore Miner's Ridge"
- Or: "Go to explore" (already tried, failed)

Actually, I just realized - the system message might be telling me to use my Exploration skill. Maybe there's an action format I haven't tried. Let me look at skill usage patterns:
- Mining is used with Gather
- Smithing might be used with a crafting action
- Exploration might need its own action type

Let me try the simplest possible command:

ACTION: Explore

LEARNING: The exploration mechanic remains mysterious. The game explicitly says "use explore action to start" but this action type isn't in the provided format list.

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I've arrived at Miner's Ridge (T27). The location shows "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" - this means I need to use an exploration action to discover what's available here.

I have Exploration L1, which should allow me to explore this area. However, I don't see an explicit "Explore" action listed in the action types available. Let me check what actions are available to me:

Looking back at the action formats:
- Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken

The "explore action" might be accomplished through:
1. Using Exploration skill somehow (not clear how)
2. Moving around the area (Go to specific locations)
3. A special action I haven't discovered yet

Let me try going to what might be a location here, or I could try the Gather action to see if there are nodes available. Actually, thinking about it - I should try to discover locations by attempting to Go to common mining locations like "ore vein" or "copper vein".

Let me try: Go to ore vein

ACTION: Go to ore vein

LEARNING: Arrived at Miner's Ridge but it's unexplored. Need to find the actual mining locations/nodes within this area.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: The Go action failed - "NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION". This tells me that:

1. I can't just guess location names to go to
2. The area is "unexplored" and I need to use an "explore action to start"
3. The explore action must be something I haven't tried yet

Looking at my available actions again:
- Go, Leave, Enrol, Gather, Fight, Store, Drop, AcceptContract, TurnInCombatToken

The hint says "use explore action" - but none of these are explicitly "Explore". However, I notice:
- Exploration is a skill I have (L1)
- Maybe exploration works differently than other skills
- Perhaps I need to look for an action that uses my Exploration skill

Wait - looking at the original action formats, I see:
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE>

But I don't know the node IDs yet. The "explore action" must reveal them.

Let me try using a generic Gather or similar. Actually, re-reading: the game says "use explore action to start" - maybe this is a context-specific action that should appear if I'm at an unexplored location. Let me try the most logical action format:

ACTION: Go to explore

LEARNING: The area is truly unexplored and requires a specific exploration action to reveal locations. Standard Go to <location> doesn't work here.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: Two failed attempts now. The game is telling me clearly: "use explore action to start". This suggests there's a specific action I need to use.

Looking at the action list again more carefully:
- Go: Travel to destinations
- Leave: Return to hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes
- Fight: Battle enemies
- Store: Put items in storage
- Drop: Discard items
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

None of these explicitly say "Explore". But wait - the game mechanics mention "You have an inventory with limited slots" and "You can learn skills and level them up through practice".

Maybe the Exploration skill works by gathering information? Or maybe "Gather" with a specific mode or without parameters?

Actually, re-reading the Gather action format:
`Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]`

But this requires a NODE_ID which I don't have because the area is unexplored.

Let me think differently - perhaps the exploration action is implicit in the Go command but with a special syntax. Or maybe I need to just try "Gather" without parameters to trigger exploration?

Let me try the simplest approach - just attempt to Gather with a generic node identifier:

ACTION: Gather node exploration APPRAISE

LEARNING: The exploration action mechanism isn't obvious from the action formats given. Need to discover the correct syntax.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: The gather action also failed. I'm stuck at an unexplored location and can't figure out the syntax for the "explore action".

Let me reconsider what I know:
- The location says "Unexplored (use explore action to start)"
- I have Exploration L1 skill
- None of the listed action types explicitly mention "Explore"
- Go, Gather, Fight all failed

Wait - maybe the exploration action is a special action that only becomes available at unexplored locations, and I should just describe what I want to do naturally. But that doesn't match the format requirement.

Actually, let me re-read the action formats more carefully. Under the "Go" action:
"Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)"

The phrase "Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)" suggests I only see areas I've already discovered. But it also says at Miner's Ridge there are "Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town" - nothing else listed.

Maybe I need to try going to a generic mining location type name. Let me try variations:

ACTION: Go to copper vein

LEARNING: Still struggling with the exploration mechanic. The "explore action" hint suggests there's a specific way to reveal the area's contents that I haven't discovered yet.

2. Gave me +1 Exploration XP
3. Revealed a new connection: Greenhold Slopes at 36 ticks away (undiscovered)

The area is STILL showing as "Unexplored" though, which means there's more to discover here. I need to keep exploring or find the actual mining nodes. Let me continue exploring to reveal the locations within Miner's Ridge itself.

ACTION: Explore

CONTINUE_IF: area still shows as unexplored

LEARNING: The "Explore" action (without parameters) works! It reveals new area connections and grants Exploration XP. The Explore action appears to have minimal or zero time cost. Need to keep exploring to reveal the actual nodes/locations within Miner's Ridge.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: Two failed attempts now. The game is telling me clearly: "use explore action to start". This suggests there's a specific action I need to use.

Looking at the action list again more carefully:
- Go: Travel to destinations
- Leave: Return to hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes
- Fight: Battle enemies
- Store: Put items in storage
- Drop: Discard items
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

None of these explicitly say "Explore". But wait - the game mechanics mention "You have an inventory with limited slots" and "You can learn skills and level them up through practice".

Maybe the Exploration skill works by gathering information? Or maybe "Gather" with a specific mode or without parameters?

Actually, re-reading the Gather action format:
`Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]`

But this requires a NODE_ID which I don't have because the area is unexplored.

Let me think differently - perhaps the exploration action is implicit in the Go command but with a special syntax. Or maybe I need to just try "Gather" without parameters to trigger exploration?

Let me try the simplest approach - just attempt to Gather with a generic node identifier:

ACTION: Gather node exploration APPRAISE

LEARNING: The exploration action mechanism isn't obvious from the action formats given. Need to discover the correct syntax.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: The gather action also failed. I'm stuck at an unexplored location and can't figure out the syntax for the "explore action".

Let me reconsider what I know:
- The location says "Unexplored (use explore action to start)"
- I have Exploration L1 skill
- None of the listed action types explicitly mention "Explore"
- Go, Gather, Fight all failed

Wait - maybe the exploration action is a special action that only becomes available at unexplored locations, and I should just describe what I want to do naturally. But that doesn't match the format requirement.

Actually, let me re-read the action formats more carefully. Under the "Go" action:
"Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)"

The phrase "Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)" suggests I only see areas I've already discovered. But it also says at Miner's Ridge there are "Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town" - nothing else listed.

Maybe I need to try going to a generic mining location type name. Let me try variations:

ACTION: Go to copper vein

LEARNING: Still struggling with the exploration mechanic. The "explore action" hint suggests there's a specific way to reveal the area's contents that I haven't discovered yet.

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: The system didn't show a result for my last action - it just re-displayed the current state. This is unusual. Let me think about what "explore action" could mean.

Looking back at the instructions, it says actions should be formatted precisely. The message says "use explore action to start" - this is a game message hinting at what I should do.

Perhaps "explore action" isn't a standard action type, but rather a special command. Let me try variations on the word "explore":
- Maybe it's just: "Explore"
- Or: "Explore Miner's Ridge"
- Or: "Go to explore" (already tried, failed)

Actually, I just realized - the system message might be telling me to use my Exploration skill. Maybe there's an action format I haven't tried. Let me look at skill usage patterns:
- Mining is used with Gather
- Smithing might be used with a crafting action
- Exploration might need its own action type

Let me try the simplest possible command:

ACTION: Explore

LEARNING: The exploration mechanic remains mysterious. The game explicitly says "use explore action to start" but this action type isn't in the provided format list.

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! The "Explore" action worked! It:
1. Cost some time (not shown explicitly but we're still at T27, so likely minimal cost or 0 ticks)
2. Gave me +1 Exploration XP
3. Revealed a new connection: Greenhold Slopes at 36 ticks away (undiscovered)

The area is STILL showing as "Unexplored" though, which means there's more to discover here. I need to keep exploring or find the actual mining nodes. Let me continue exploring to reveal the locations within Miner's Ridge itself.

ACTION: Explore

CONTINUE_IF: area still shows as unexplored

LEARNING: The "Explore" action (without parameters) works! It reveals new area connections and grants Exploration XP. The Explore action appears to have minimal or zero time cost. Need to keep exploring to reveal the actual nodes/locations within Miner's Ridge.

Gathering:
  Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

You set CONTINUE_IF: area still shows as unexplored

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Excellent progress! The second Explore action revealed the actual gathering locations:
- Ore vein with Copper Ore (available now) and Tin Ore (requires L2 Mining)

The area now shows "Partly explored" instead of "Unexplored", and I can see a gathering node. The CONTINUE_IF condition is no longer met since it's now "Partly explored" not "Unexplored".

Now I should gather resources. I have Mining L1 with FOCUS mode available. I should:
1. Go to the ore vein
2. Gather copper ore using FOCUS mode (since I know the material ID)

Let me go to the ore vein first.

ACTION: Go to ore vein

LEARNING: The Explore action revealed gathering locations within the area. After 2 explores, Miner's Ridge shows "Partly explored" with an ore vein containing Copper Ore and Tin Ore (L2 locked).

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

- Ore vein with Copper Ore (available now) and Tin Ore (requires L2 Mining)

The area now shows "Partly explored" instead of "Unexplored", and I can see a gathering node. The CONTINUE_IF condition is no longer met since it's now "Partly explored" not "Unexplored".

Now I should gather resources. I have Mining L1 with FOCUS mode available. I should:
1. Go to the ore vein
2. Gather copper ore using FOCUS mode (since I know the material ID)

Let me go to the ore vein first.

ACTION: Go to ore vein

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: The "Go to ore vein" command failed with "NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION". This is the same error I got before when trying to navigate.

Looking at the location display, it shows:
- "Gathering: Ore vein - ..."

This is listed as a section at the current location, not as a separate destination to travel to. The ore vein appears to be accessible from where I am now, not through a "Go" command.

I think the ore vein is right here at Miner's Ridge, and I should use the Gather action directly on it. The node ID is likely "ore vein" or similar. Let me try gathering from the ore vein using FOCUS mode on COPPER_ORE.

ACTION: Gather node ore-vein FOCUS COPPER_ORE

LEARNING: Locations within an area (like ore veins) cannot be accessed via "Go" command. They're available directly from the parent location and should be gathered from using the Gather action.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: The gather action also failed. I'm stuck at an unexplored location and can't figure out the syntax for the "explore action".

Let me reconsider what I know:
- The location says "Unexplored (use explore action to start)"
- I have Exploration L1 skill
- None of the listed action types explicitly mention "Explore"
- Go, Gather, Fight all failed

Wait - maybe the exploration action is a special action that only becomes available at unexplored locations, and I should just describe what I want to do naturally. But that doesn't match the format requirement.

Actually, let me re-read the action formats more carefully. Under the "Go" action:
"Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)"

The phrase "Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)" suggests I only see areas I've already discovered. But it also says at Miner's Ridge there are "Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town" - nothing else listed.

Maybe I need to try going to a generic mining location type name. Let me try variations:

ACTION: Go to copper vein

LEARNING: Still struggling with the exploration mechanic. The "explore action" hint suggests there's a specific way to reveal the area's contents that I haven't discovered yet.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: The system didn't show a result for my last action - it just re-displayed the current state. This is unusual. Let me think about what "explore action" could mean.

Looking back at the instructions, it says actions should be formatted precisely. The message says "use explore action to start" - this is a game message hinting at what I should do.

Perhaps "explore action" isn't a standard action type, but rather a special command. Let me try variations on the word "explore":
- Maybe it's just: "Explore"
- Or: "Explore Miner's Ridge"
- Or: "Go to explore" (already tried, failed)

Actually, I just realized - the system message might be telling me to use my Exploration skill. Maybe there's an action format I haven't tried. Let me look at skill usage patterns:
- Mining is used with Gather
- Smithing might be used with a crafting action
- Exploration might need its own action type

Let me try the simplest possible command:

ACTION: Explore

LEARNING: The exploration mechanic remains mysterious. The game explicitly says "use explore action to start" but this action type isn't in the provided format list.

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! The "Explore" action worked! It:
1. Cost some time (not shown explicitly but we're still at T27, so likely minimal cost or 0 ticks)
2. Gave me +1 Exploration XP
3. Revealed a new connection: Greenhold Slopes at 36 ticks away (undiscovered)

The area is STILL showing as "Unexplored" though, which means there's more to discover here. I need to keep exploring or find the actual mining nodes. Let me continue exploring to reveal the locations within Miner's Ridge itself.

ACTION: Explore

CONTINUE_IF: area still shows as unexplored

LEARNING: The "Explore" action (without parameters) works! It reveals new area connections and grants Exploration XP. The Explore action appears to have minimal or zero time cost. Need to keep exploring to reveal the actual nodes/locations within Miner's Ridge.

Partly explored

Gathering:
  Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

You set CONTINUE_IF: area still shows as unexplored

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent progress! The second Explore action revealed the actual gathering locations:
- Ore vein with Copper Ore (available now) and Tin Ore (requires L2 Mining)

The area now shows "Partly explored" instead of "Unexplored", and I can see a gathering node. The CONTINUE_IF condition is no longer met since it's now "Partly explored" not "Unexplored".

Now I should gather resources. I have Mining L1 with FOCUS mode available. I should:
1. Go to the ore vein
2. Gather copper ore using FOCUS mode (since I know the material ID)

Let me go to the ore vein first.

ACTION: Go to ore vein

LEARNING: The Explore action revealed gathering locations within the area. After 2 explores, Miner's Ridge shows "Partly explored" with an ore vein containing Copper Ore and Tin Ore (L2 locked).

REASONING: The node ID "ore-vein" doesn't exist. The display shows "Ore vein" with a capital O and a space. Let me try different formatting:
- "Ore vein" (with capital and space)

The format requires: Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]

Let me try with the exact text shown in the interface.

** Miner's Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! The "Explore" action worked! It:
1. Cost some time (not shown explicitly but we're still at T27, so likely minimal cost or 0 ticks)
2. Gave me +1 Exploration XP
3. Revealed a new connection: Greenhold Slopes at 36 ticks away (undiscovered)

The area is STILL showing as "Unexplored" though, which means there's more to discover here. I need to keep exploring or find the actual mining nodes. Let me continue exploring to reveal the locations within Miner's Ridge itself.

ACTION: Explore

CONTINUE_IF: area still shows as unexplored

LEARNING: The "Explore" action (without parameters) works! It reveals new area connections and grants Exploration XP. The Explore action appears to have minimal or zero time cost. Need to keep exploring to reveal the actual nodes/locations within Miner's Ridge.

** Miner's Ridge **

Partly explored

Gathering:
  Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

You set CONTINUE_IF: area still shows as unexplored

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent progress! The second Explore action revealed the actual gathering locations:
- Ore vein with Copper Ore (available now) and Tin Ore (requires L2 Mining)

The area now shows "Partly explored" instead of "Unexplored", and I can see a gathering node. The CONTINUE_IF condition is no longer met since it's now "Partly explored" not "Unexplored".

Now I should gather resources. I have Mining L1 with FOCUS mode available. I should:
1. Go to the ore vein
2. Gather copper ore using FOCUS mode (since I know the material ID)

Let me go to the ore vein first.

ACTION: Go to ore vein

LEARNING: The Explore action revealed gathering locations within the area. After 2 explores, Miner's Ridge shows "Partly explored" with an ore vein containing Copper Ore and Tin Ore (L2 locked).

Partly explored

Gathering:
  Ore vein - Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)

Connections closer to Town: 18t - Town
Connections at this distance: 36t - Greenhold Slopes (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: The "Go to ore vein" command failed with "NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION". This is the same error I got before when trying to navigate.

Looking at the location display, it shows:
- "Gathering: Ore vein - ..."

This is listed as a section at the current location, not as a separate destination to travel to. The ore vein appears to be accessible from where I am now, not through a "Go" command.

I think the ore vein is right here at Miner's Ridge, and I should use the Gather action directly on it. The node ID is likely "ore vein" or similar. Let me try gathering from the ore vein using FOCUS mode on COPPER_ORE.

ACTION: Gather node ore-vein FOCUS COPPER_ORE

LEARNING: Locations within an area (like ore veins) cannot be accessed via "Go" command. They're available directly from the parent location and should be gathered from using the Gather action.

[assistant]: REASONING: The node ID "ore-vein" doesn't exist. The display shows "Ore vein" with a capital O and a space. Let me try different formatting:
- "Ore vein" (with capital and space)
- "ore vein" (lowercase with space)

The format requires: Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]

Let me try with the exact text shown in the interface.

ACTION: Gather node Ore vein FOCUS COPPER_ORE

LEARNING: Node ID naming convention unclear - "ore-vein" failed, trying the displayed name format instead.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Both "ore-vein" and "Ore vein" failed. The system is showing "undefined" for the node ID, which suggests the parser isn't recognizing my format.

Looking back at the action format: "Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]"

Maybe I need to explore more to get the actual node ID. The area shows "Partly explored" - perhaps I need to continue exploring to fully reveal the node IDs. Let me try exploring again.

ACTION: Explore

LEARNING: Node IDs aren't revealed by just seeing "Ore vein" listed. Need to continue exploring to get proper node identifiers.
