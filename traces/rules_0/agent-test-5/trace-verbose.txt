--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name | location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm starting a new game with an empty inventory and no skills. I'm in the Town Square with access to various guilds and a warehouse. My goal is to have fun while learning how this game works. I should start by exploring and understanding what's available. The best approach is to visit one of the guilds to learn what activities are possible and what skills I can develop. Let me start with the Miners Guild since mining is often a fundamental resource gathering activity.

ACTION: go Miners Guild

LEARNING: None yet - this is my first action in the game.

NOTES:
- LOCATION MAP: Town Square has 6 guilds (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers) and a Warehouse
- INVENTORY: 0/20 slots
- SKILLS: None learned yet
- GOAL: Explore and have fun while gathering resources and progressing

CONTINUE_IF: I can see what's at the Miners Guild

Previous action result:
Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

You set CONTINUE_IF: I can see what's at the Miners Guild

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Great! I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. This is interesting - it seems backwards from what I'd expect (usually you mine ore to get bars), so this might be a crafting or conversion contract rather than a mining task.

I can enrol to join the guild or leave. Enrolling will likely let me learn the Mining skill and access mining-related activities. Let me enrol to start learning about mining.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: 
- Miners Guild has a contract system where you can trade resources for reputation
- Contract miners-guild-1: Requires 2 COPPER_BAR → Gives 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 rep (seems like a reverse smelting operation)

NOTES:
- LOCATION MAP: Town Square has 6 guilds (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers) and a Warehouse

REASONING: Excellent! I've enrolled in Mining and learned the skill at Level 1. I can see that:
- Mining has a FOCUS mode (likely for efficient gathering)
- APPRAISE is available at Level 3 (a future unlock)
- The action cost 3 ticks

Now I need to find copper ore to mine. I should explore the world to find mining nodes. Let me leave the guild and explore to find where I can actually mine. I'll check out different areas to map the world and find resource nodes.

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.

Let me start with the Miners Guild since mining is often a fundamental resource gathering activity.

ACTION: go Miners Guild

LEARNING: None yet - this is my first action in the game.

NOTES:
- LOCATION MAP: Town Square has 6 guilds (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers) and a Warehouse
- INVENTORY: 0/20 slots
- SKILLS: None learned yet
- GOAL: Explore and have fun while gathering resources and progressing

CONTINUE_IF: I can see what's at the Miners Guild

[user]: Result: T0: TravelToLocation → OK

[user]: Previous action result:
Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

You set CONTINUE_IF: I can see what's at the Miners Guild

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. This is interesting - it seems backwards from what I'd expect (usually you mine ore to get bars), so this might be a crafting or conversion contract rather than a mining task.

I can enrol to join the guild or leave. Enrolling will likely let me learn the Mining skill and access mining-related activities. Let me enrol to start learning about mining.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: 
- Miners Guild has a contract system where you can trade resources for reputation
- Contract miners-guild-1: Requires 2 COPPER_BAR → Gives 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 rep (seems like a reverse smelting operation)

NOTES:
- LOCATION MAP: Town Square has 6 guilds (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers) and a Warehouse
- INVENTORY: 0/20 slots
- SKILLS: None learned yet
- GOAL: Explore and have fun while gathering resources and progressing
- MINERS GUILD: Contract miners-guild-1 available (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 rep)

[user]: Result: T0: Enrol Mining → 3t

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! I've enrolled in Mining and learned the skill at Level 1. I can see that:
- Mining has a FOCUS mode (likely for efficient gathering)
- APPRAISE is available at Level 3 (a future unlock)
- The action cost 3 ticks

Now I need to find copper ore to mine. I should explore the world to find mining nodes. Let me leave the guild and explore to find where I can actually mine. I'll check out different areas to map the world and find resource nodes.

ACTION: leave

LEARNING:
- Enrolling in a guild costs ticks (3t for Mining) and grants a skill at Level 1
- Skills have special modes/abilities (FOCUS, APPRAISE at L3)
- I now have the Mining skill and can mine resources

NOTES:
- LOCATION MAP: Town Square has 6 guilds (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers) and a Warehouse
- INVENTORY: 0/20 slots
- SKILLS: Mining L1 [FOCUS available, APPRAISE at L3]
- GOAL: Explore and have fun while gathering resources and progressing
- MINERS GUILD: Contract miners-guild-1 available (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 rep)
- MECHANIC: Guild enrollment costs ticks and grants starting skill

Location: Town Square in TOWN

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections: none known

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm back in the Town Square. I have Mining L1 with FOCUS available, but I need to find where the actual copper ore deposits are. The "Connections: none known" suggests there are other areas beyond the Town Square that I haven't discovered yet. Let me explore to find new locations and mining nodes. I'll use the explore action to search for new areas.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: I should map out the world to find resource gathering locations.

NOTES:

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name | location in current area>

- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! I've enrolled in Mining and learned the skill at Level 1. I can see that:
- Mining has a FOCUS mode (likely for efficient gathering)
- APPRAISE is available at Level 3 (a future unlock)
- The action cost 3 ticks

Now I need to find copper ore to mine. I should explore the world to find mining nodes. Let me leave the guild and explore to find where I can actually mine. I'll check out different areas to map the world and find resource nodes.

ACTION: leave

LEARNING:
- Enrolling in a guild costs ticks (3t for Mining) and grants a skill at Level 1
- Skills have special modes/abilities (FOCUS, APPRAISE at L3)

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Ah, I see! "Undiscovered" means I can't travel there directly yet - I need to explore more to establish a path. "Unexplored" means I can travel there but haven't been yet. Let me go to Greenward Heath first since it's already accessible, and then explore from there to discover Silvermark Ridge and establish a path to it.

ACTION: fartravel Greenward Heath

LEARNING:
- "Undiscovered" areas cannot be reached by fartravel - need to explore to establish paths
- "Unexplored" areas can be traveled to directly
- Areas need to be discovered through exploration before they become accessible via fartravel

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name | location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

Connections further from Town: 29t - Greenward Heath (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! Now I can see a connection has appeared: "Greenward Heath (unexplored)" which is 29 ticks away. This is likely where I can find resources to gather. But before I travel that far, let me use the explore action here in Town Square to see if there are closer areas to discover. I have Exploration L1 now, so I should be able to explore.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Travel times are shown in the location connections (29t to Greenward Heath)
- New connections appear once I have the Exploration skill

Connections further from Town: 12t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 29t - Greenward Heath (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! The explore action discovered a new closer location: Silvermark Ridge at 12 ticks away. This is much closer than Greenward Heath at 29 ticks. I should travel to Silvermark Ridge to see what resources and opportunities are there. Let me use fartravel to go there.

ACTION: fartravel Silvermark Ridge

LEARNING:
- Explore action can discover new areas and adds XP to the Exploration skill
- There are multiple resource gathering areas at different distances from Town Square
- Silvermark Ridge is closer and thus more efficient to reach than Greenward Heath

Connections further from Town: 12t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 29t - Greenward Heath (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Ah, I see! "Undiscovered" means I can't travel there directly yet - I need to explore more to establish a path. "Unexplored" means I can travel there but haven't been yet. Let me go to Greenward Heath first since it's already accessible, and then explore from there to discover Silvermark Ridge and establish a path to it.

ACTION: fartravel Greenward Heath

LEARNING:
- "Undiscovered" areas cannot be reached by fartravel - need to explore to establish paths
- "Unexplored" areas can be traveled to directly
- Areas need to be discovered through exploration before they become accessible via fartravel

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town

[assistant]: REASONING: Perfect! I'm now at Greenward Heath, which is unexplored. Let me use the explore action here to see what resources and connections are available in this area. This should reveal what's here and potentially lead to discovering other areas.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Greenward Heath is an unexplored area with no visible resources or connections yet
- Need to explore to reveal what's available

Connections at this distance: 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! Exploring revealed a new connection: Settler's Meadow at 39 ticks away (undiscovered). But I still see "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" which suggests there's more to discover here locally. Let me continue exploring this area to find local resources before traveling further.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Explore action reveals new distant connections and also progresses exploration of the current area
- Multiple explore actions may be needed to fully explore an area

Partly explored

Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Excellent progress! Now I can see:
1. Greenward Heath is "Partly explored" - there may be more to explore here
2. Silvermark Ridge is now much closer at 7 ticks (from this location) and still undiscovered
3. The explore action is revealing new connections

Since I'm at 145 ticks and have limited session time, I should be strategic. Let me continue exploring Greenward Heath to see if there are local resources (mining nodes, etc.) before moving on. This will help me understand what gathering opportunities exist.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Exploring reveals new connections at different distances from current location
- Areas can be "Partly explored" and require more exploration to fully reveal

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name | location in current area>

1. Greenward Heath is "Partly explored" - there may be more to explore here
2. Silvermark Ridge is now much closer at 7 ticks (from this location) and still undiscovered
3. The explore action is revealing new connections

Since I'm at 145 ticks and have limited session time, I should be strategic. Let me continue exploring Greenward Heath to see if there are local resources (mining nodes, etc.) before moving on. This will help me understand what gathering opportunities exist.

Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)
Connections further from Town: 31t - Wolfvale Borderlands (undiscovered)

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Great! Greenward Heath is now fully explored and I've discovered a third undiscovered area: Wolfvale Borderlands. However, I notice that Greenward Heath itself doesn't show any local resources or locations to visit (like mining nodes). This suggests that resources might only be at specific named locations, not in the transit areas.

Since I've spent 187 ticks and need to be mindful of session limits, let me explore Silvermark Ridge which is only 7 ticks away. This is closer than going back to Town Square (29 ticks), and it's a new area that might have resources.

ACTION: fartravel Silvermark Ridge

LEARNING:
- Greenward Heath is a transit/exploration area with no local resources, just connections to other areas
- Multiple explore actions fully explore an area and reveal all distant connections
- Areas can have undiscovered status even when seen in the connection list

Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections further from Town: 12t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 29t - Greenward Heath (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Ah, I see! "Undiscovered" means I can't travel there directly yet - I need to explore more to establish a path. "Unexplored" means I can travel there but haven't been yet. Let me go to Greenward Heath first since it's already accessible, and then explore from there to discover Silvermark Ridge and establish a path to it.

ACTION: fartravel Greenward Heath

LEARNING:
- "Undiscovered" areas cannot be reached by fartravel - need to explore to establish paths
- "Unexplored" areas can be traveled to directly
- Areas need to be discovered through exploration before they become accessible via fartravel

[assistant]: REASONING: Perfect! I'm now at Greenward Heath, which is unexplored. Let me use the explore action here to see what resources and connections are available in this area. This should reveal what's here and potentially lead to discovering other areas.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Greenward Heath is an unexplored area with no visible resources or connections yet

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! Exploring revealed a new connection: Settler's Meadow at 39 ticks away (undiscovered). But I still see "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" which suggests there's more to discover here locally. Let me continue exploring this area to find local resources before traveling further.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Explore action reveals new distant connections and also progresses exploration of the current area

Partly explored

Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent progress! Now I can see:
1. Greenward Heath is "Partly explored" - there may be more to explore here
2. Silvermark Ridge is now much closer at 7 ticks (from this location) and still undiscovered
3. The explore action is revealing new connections

Since I'm at 145 ticks and have limited session time, I should be strategic. Let me continue exploring Greenward Heath to see if there are local resources (mining nodes, etc.) before moving on. This will help me understand what gathering opportunities exist.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Exploring reveals new connections at different distances from current location
- Areas can be "Partly explored" and require more exploration to fully reveal
- Exploration is helping me map out the world structure

Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)
Connections further from Town: 31t - Wolfvale Borderlands (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! Greenward Heath is now fully explored and I've discovered a third undiscovered area: Wolfvale Borderlands. However, I notice that Greenward Heath itself doesn't show any local resources or locations to visit (like mining nodes). This suggests that resources might only be at specific named locations, not in the transit areas.

Since I've spent 187 ticks and need to be mindful of session limits, let me explore Silvermark Ridge which is only 7 ticks away. This is closer than going back to Town Square (29 ticks), and it's a new area that might have resources.

ACTION: fartravel Silvermark Ridge

LEARNING:
- Greenward Heath is a transit/exploration area with no local resources, just connections to other areas
- Multiple explore actions fully explore an area and reveal all distant connections
- Areas can have undiscovered status even when seen in the connection list

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Ah! I made a critical mistake. Even though Silvermark Ridge is listed in the connections, it's still "undiscovered" - meaning there's no path established to it yet. I can see it from here, but I can't fartravel to it directly. I need to use the explore action while at Greenward Heath to discover the path to Silvermark Ridge, similar to how I discovered new areas earlier.

Let me try exploring again to establish a path to Silvermark Ridge.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- "Undiscovered" areas in the connections list cannot be fartraveled to directly
- You must explore from your current location to establish/discover the path to undiscovered areas
- Multiple explores may be needed, or exploring might establish paths to visible undiscovered connections

REASONING: Interesting! The area is fully explored, so I can't explore further. But Silvermark Ridge is still undiscovered and unreachable via fartravel. This suggests I need to go back to Town Square and establish the path from there, or perhaps there's a different exploration path needed.

Let me go back to Town Square, which is 29 ticks away. From there, I can explore to discover paths to the undiscovered areas, or I can check if there are other areas to explore that might lead to Silvermark Ridge.

ACTION: fartravel Town

- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

** Greenward Heath **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
Connections at this distance: 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! Exploring revealed a new connection: Settler's Meadow at 39 ticks away (undiscovered). But I still see "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" which suggests there's more to discover here locally. Let me continue exploring this area to find local resources before traveling further.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Explore action reveals new distant connections and also progresses exploration of the current area
- Multiple explore actions may be needed to fully explore an area

** Greenward Heath **

Partly explored

Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent progress! Now I can see:
1. Greenward Heath is "Partly explored" - there may be more to explore here
2. Silvermark Ridge is now much closer at 7 ticks (from this location) and still undiscovered
3. The explore action is revealing new connections

Since I'm at 145 ticks and have limited session time, I should be strategic. Let me continue exploring Greenward Heath to see if there are local resources (mining nodes, etc.) before moving on. This will help me understand what gathering opportunities exist.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Exploring reveals new connections at different distances from current location
- Areas can be "Partly explored" and require more exploration to fully reveal
- Exploration is helping me map out the world structure

** Greenward Heath **

Fully explored!

Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)
Connections further from Town: 31t - Wolfvale Borderlands (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! Greenward Heath is now fully explored and I've discovered a third undiscovered area: Wolfvale Borderlands. However, I notice that Greenward Heath itself doesn't show any local resources or locations to visit (like mining nodes). This suggests that resources might only be at specific named locations, not in the transit areas.

Since I've spent 187 ticks and need to be mindful of session limits, let me explore Silvermark Ridge which is only 7 ticks away. This is closer than going back to Town Square (29 ticks), and it's a new area that might have resources.

ACTION: fartravel Silvermark Ridge

LEARNING:
- Greenward Heath is a transit/exploration area with no local resources, just connections to other areas
- Multiple explore actions fully explore an area and reveal all distant connections
- Areas can have undiscovered status even when seen in the connection list

Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)
Connections further from Town: 31t - Wolfvale Borderlands (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Ah! I made a critical mistake. Even though Silvermark Ridge is listed in the connections, it's still "undiscovered" - meaning there's no path established to it yet. I can see it from here, but I can't fartravel to it directly. I need to use the explore action while at Greenward Heath to discover the path to Silvermark Ridge, similar to how I discovered new areas earlier.

Let me try exploring again to establish a path to Silvermark Ridge.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- "Undiscovered" areas in the connections list cannot be fartraveled to directly
- You must explore from your current location to establish/discover the path to undiscovered areas
- Multiple explores may be needed, or exploring might establish paths to visible undiscovered connections

Connections further from Town: 31t - Wolfvale Borderlands (undiscovered)

[assistant]: REASONING: Interesting! The area is fully explored, so I can't explore further. But Silvermark Ridge is still undiscovered and unreachable via fartravel. This suggests I need to go back to Town Square and establish the path from there, or perhaps there's a different exploration path needed.

Let me go back to Town Square, which is 29 ticks away. From there, I can explore to discover paths to the undiscovered areas, or I can check if there are other areas to explore that might lead to Silvermark Ridge.

ACTION: fartravel Town

LEARNING:
- An area can be "fully explored" locally but still have undiscovered connections
- To discover paths to undiscovered areas, I may need to explore from different locations
- Greenward Heath's explorations didn't establish paths to its undiscovered connections

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Excellent! Now I'm back at Town Square (T352). I can see that from here, Silvermark Ridge is only 12 ticks away and still undiscovered. This is different from the 7 ticks I saw from Greenward Heath - distances vary by direction/location.

I have two critical realizations:
1. I've spent 352 ticks ONLY exploring without gathering any resources
2. The MINERS GUILD has a contract I can do, but I need COPPER_BAR to trade for COPPER_ORE + reputation
3. I need to focus on actual resource gathering now

Let me explore from Town Square to discover the path to Silvermark Ridge, which might have resources I can gather.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Distances between areas vary depending on which location you're traveling from
- I need to establish paths to undiscovered areas to access them
- Time is running out - I must shift to productive gathering soon

TICK 508
================================================================================

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name | location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

- KNOWN AREAS: Silvermark Ridge (12t away from Town, undiscovered), Greenward Heath (fully explored), Settler's Meadow (39t away from Greenward Heath, undiscovered), Wolfvale Borderlands (31t away from Greenward Heath, undiscovered)
- CRITICAL ISSUE: Spent 352 ticks exploring without gathering any resources; MUST focus on productive gathering now

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Good! Exploration revealed a new connection: Settler's Meadow is now visible at 23t from Town (closer than the 39t from Greenward Heath). Silvermark Ridge is still undiscovered at 12t.

I'm at T352 and need to be strategic about remaining time. Let me continue exploring to discover Silvermark Ridge, which is the closest undiscovered area and likely has resources I can mine.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING:
- Exploring from Town Square is revealing new connections and adjusting distances
- Multiple explores may be needed to discover paths to undiscovered areas
- Settler's Meadow appears to be accessible from Town Square at a better distance than from Greenward Heath
