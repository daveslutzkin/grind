TRACE LOG
================================================================================

=== TICK 0 ===

REASONING:
  I'm starting a new game with an empty inventory and no skills. I'm in the Town Square with access to various guilds and a warehouse. My goal is to have fun while learning how this game works. I should start by exploring and understanding what's available. The best approach is to visit one of the guilds to learn what activities are possible and what skills I can develop. Let me start with the Miners Guild since mining is often a fundamental resource gathering activity.

LEARNING:
  None yet - this is my first action in the game.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Miners Guild"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Miners Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: none
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  Great! I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. This is interesting - it seems backwards from what I'd expect (usually you mine ore to get bars), so this might be a crafting or conversion contract rather than a mining task.
  
  I can enrol to join the guild or leave. Enrolling will likely let me learn the Mining skill and access mining-related activities. Let me enrol to start learning about mining.

LEARNING:
  - Miners Guild has a contract system where you can trade resources for reputation
  - Contract miners-guild-1: Requires 2 COPPER_BAR → Gives 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 rep (seems like a reverse smelting operation)

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Mining guild (3t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent! I've enrolled in Mining and learned the skill at Level 1. I can see that:
  - Mining has a FOCUS mode (likely for efficient gathering)
  - APPRAISE is available at Level 3 (a future unlock)
  - The action cost 3 ticks
  
  Now I need to find copper ore to mine. I should explore the world to find mining nodes. Let me leave the guild and explore to find where I can actually mine. I'll check out different areas to map the world and find resource nodes.

LEARNING:
  - Enrolling in a guild costs ticks (3t for Mining) and grants a skill at Level 1
  - Skills have special modes/abilities (FOCUS, APPRAISE at L3)
  - I now have the Mining skill and can mine resources

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Miners Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections: none known

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  I'm back in the Town Square. I have Mining L1 with FOCUS available, but I need to find where the actual copper ore deposits are. The "Connections: none known" suggests there are other areas beyond the Town Square that I haven't discovered yet. Let me explore to find new locations and mining nodes. I'll use the explore action to search for new areas.

LEARNING:
  I should map out the world to find resource gathering locations.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Not in Exploration Guild!

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections: none known

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  Ah, I see! The explore action requires me to be enrolled in the Explorers Guild first. That makes sense - it's a gated mechanic. I need to enrol in the Explorers Guild to gain the ability to explore new areas. Let me go there and enrol.

LEARNING:
  - The explore action requires membership in the Explorers Guild
  - Different guilds provide different capabilities and skills

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Explorers Guild"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Explorers Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

=== TICK 6 ===

REASONING:
  I'm at the Explorers Guild now. I can enrol to gain the Exploration skill and unlock the explore action. This will let me discover new areas and resource gathering locations. Let me enrol.

LEARNING:
  - Explorers Guild provides the ability to explore new areas

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Exploration guild, discovered Greenward Heath (29t travel time)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

=== TICK 6 ===

REASONING:
  Great! I've enrolled in the Explorers Guild and gained Exploration L1. Now I can use the explore action to discover new areas. Let me leave and head back to Town Square, then use explore to find new locations with resources.

LEARNING:
  - Enrolling in Explorers Guild also costs 3 ticks and grants Exploration L1

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Explorers Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 29t - Greenward Heath (unexplored)

=== TICK 14 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent! Now I can see a connection has appeared: "Greenward Heath (unexplored)" which is 29 ticks away. This is likely where I can find resources to gather. But before I travel that far, let me use the explore action here in Town Square to see if there are closer areas to discover. I have Exploration L1 now, so I should be able to explore.

LEARNING:
  - Travel times are shown in the location connections (29t to Greenward Heath)
  - New connections appear once I have the Exploration skill

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Silvermark Ridge (12t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (24 to next level, 4% there)
    RNG: lucky (19% percentile) - took 8t, 45t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 12t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 29t - Greenward Heath (unexplored)

=== TICK 14 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent! The explore action discovered a new closer location: Silvermark Ridge at 12 ticks away. This is much closer than Greenward Heath at 29 ticks. I should travel to Silvermark Ridge to see what resources and opportunities are there. Let me use fartravel to go there.

LEARNING:
  - Explore action can discover new areas and adds XP to the Exploration skill
  - There are multiple resource gathering areas at different distances from Town Square
  - Silvermark Ridge is closer and thus more efficient to reach than Greenward Heath

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"Silvermark Ridge"}

RESULT:
  ✗ No path to destination!

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 12t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 29t - Greenward Heath (unexplored)

=== TICK 43 ===

REASONING:
  Ah, I see! "Undiscovered" means I can't travel there directly yet - I need to explore more to establish a path. "Unexplored" means I can travel there but haven't been yet. Let me go to Greenward Heath first since it's already accessible, and then explore from there to discover Silvermark Ridge and establish a path to it.

LEARNING:
  - "Undiscovered" areas cannot be reached by fartravel - need to explore to establish paths
  - "Unexplored" areas can be traveled to directly
  - Areas need to be discovered through exploration before they become accessible via fartravel

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"Greenward Heath"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Far traveled to Greenward Heath (1 hop) (29t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenward Heath **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town

=== TICK 145 ===

REASONING:
  Perfect! I'm now at Greenward Heath, which is unexplored. Let me use the explore action here to see what resources and connections are available in this area. This should reveal what's here and potentially lead to discovering other areas.

LEARNING:
  - Greenward Heath is an unexplored area with no visible resources or connections yet
  - Need to explore to reveal what's available

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Settler's Meadow (39t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (23 to next level, 8% there)
    RNG: unlucky (61% percentile) - took 102t, 22t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenward Heath **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)

=== TICK 187 ===

REASONING:
  Great! Exploring revealed a new connection: Settler's Meadow at 39 ticks away (undiscovered). But I still see "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" which suggests there's more to discover here locally. Let me continue exploring this area to find local resources before traveling further.

LEARNING:
  - Explore action reveals new distant connections and also progresses exploration of the current area
  - Multiple explore actions may be needed to fully explore an area

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Silvermark Ridge (7t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (22 to next level, 12% there)
    RNG: lucky (32% percentile) - took 42t, 38t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenward Heath **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)

=== TICK 323 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent progress! Now I can see:
  1. Greenward Heath is "Partly explored" - there may be more to explore here
  2. Silvermark Ridge is now much closer at 7 ticks (from this location) and still undiscovered
  3. The explore action is revealing new connections
  
  Since I'm at 145 ticks and have limited session time, I should be strategic. Let me continue exploring Greenward Heath to see if there are local resources (mining nodes, etc.) before moving on. This will help me understand what gathering opportunities exist.

LEARNING:
  - Exploring reveals new connections at different distances from current location
  - Areas can be "Partly explored" and require more exploration to fully reveal
  - Exploration is helping me map out the world structure

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Wolfvale Borderlands (31t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (21 to next level, 16% there)
    RNG: unlucky (76% percentile) - took 136t, 56t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenward Heath **
  
  Fully explored!
  
  Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)
  Connections further from Town: 31t - Wolfvale Borderlands (undiscovered)

=== TICK 323 ===

REASONING:
  Great! Greenward Heath is now fully explored and I've discovered a third undiscovered area: Wolfvale Borderlands. However, I notice that Greenward Heath itself doesn't show any local resources or locations to visit (like mining nodes). This suggests that resources might only be at specific named locations, not in the transit areas.
  
  Since I've spent 187 ticks and need to be mindful of session limits, let me explore Silvermark Ridge which is only 7 ticks away. This is closer than going back to Town Square (29 ticks), and it's a new area that might have resources.

LEARNING:
  - Greenward Heath is a transit/exploration area with no local resources, just connections to other areas
  - Multiple explore actions fully explore an area and reveal all distant connections
  - Areas can have undiscovered status even when seen in the connection list

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"Silvermark Ridge"}

RESULT:
  ✗ No path to destination!

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenward Heath **
  
  Fully explored!
  
  Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)
  Connections further from Town: 31t - Wolfvale Borderlands (undiscovered)

=== TICK 323 ===

REASONING:
  Ah! I made a critical mistake. Even though Silvermark Ridge is listed in the connections, it's still "undiscovered" - meaning there's no path established to it yet. I can see it from here, but I can't fartravel to it directly. I need to use the explore action while at Greenward Heath to discover the path to Silvermark Ridge, similar to how I discovered new areas earlier.
  
  Let me try exploring again to establish a path to Silvermark Ridge.

LEARNING:
  - "Undiscovered" areas in the connections list cannot be fartraveled to directly
  - You must explore from your current location to establish/discover the path to undiscovered areas
  - Multiple explores may be needed, or exploring might establish paths to visible undiscovered connections

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Area fully explored!

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenward Heath **
  
  Fully explored!
  
  Connections closer to Town: 29t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 7t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 39t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered)
  Connections further from Town: 31t - Wolfvale Borderlands (undiscovered)

=== TICK 352 ===

REASONING:
  Interesting! The area is fully explored, so I can't explore further. But Silvermark Ridge is still undiscovered and unreachable via fartravel. This suggests I need to go back to Town Square and establish the path from there, or perhaps there's a different exploration path needed.
  
  Let me go back to Town Square, which is 29 ticks away. From there, I can explore to discover paths to the undiscovered areas, or I can check if there are other areas to explore that might lead to Silvermark Ridge.

LEARNING:
  - An area can be "fully explored" locally but still have undiscovered connections
  - To discover paths to undiscovered areas, I may need to explore from different locations
  - Greenward Heath's explorations didn't establish paths to its undiscovered connections

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"Town"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Far traveled to Town (1 hop) (29t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 12t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 29t - Greenward Heath (fully explored)

=== TICK 358 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent! Now I'm back at Town Square (T352). I can see that from here, Silvermark Ridge is only 12 ticks away and still undiscovered. This is different from the 7 ticks I saw from Greenward Heath - distances vary by direction/location.
  
  I have two critical realizations:
  1. I've spent 352 ticks ONLY exploring without gathering any resources
  2. The MINERS GUILD has a contract I can do, but I need COPPER_BAR to trade for COPPER_ORE + reputation
  3. I need to focus on actual resource gathering now
  
  Let me explore from Town Square to discover the path to Silvermark Ridge, which might have resources I can gather.

LEARNING:
  - Distances between areas vary depending on which location you're traveling from
  - I need to establish paths to undiscovered areas to access them
  - Time is running out - I must shift to productive gathering soon

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Settler's Meadow (23t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (20 to next level, 20% there)
    RNG: lucky (18% percentile) - took 6t, 47t faster than expected

  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 12t - Silvermark Ridge (undiscovered), 23t - Settler's Meadow (undiscovered), 29t - Greenward Heath (fully explored)

=== TICK 508 ===

REASONING:
  Good! Exploration revealed a new connection: Settler's Meadow is now visible at 23t from Town (closer than the 39t from Greenward Heath). Silvermark Ridge is still undiscovered at 12t.
  
  I'm at T352 and need to be strategic about remaining time. Let me continue exploring to discover Silvermark Ridge, which is the closest undiscovered area and likely has resources I can mine.

LEARNING:
  - Exploring from Town Square is revealing new connections and adjusting distances
  - Multiple explores may be needed to discover paths to undiscovered areas
  - Settler's Meadow appears to be accessible from Town Square at a better distance than from Greenward Heath

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Ember Ridge (44t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (19 to next level, 24% there)
    RNG: very unlucky (97% percentile) - took 150t, 97t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
