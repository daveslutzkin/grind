TRACE LOG
================================================================================

=== TICK 0 ===

REASONING:
  I'm starting a new game and know nothing about the world yet. I'm in the Town Square with access to several guilds and a warehouse. Since this is a resource gathering game, I should explore the guilds to understand what options are available. The Miners Guild seems like a good starting point since mining is typically a fundamental resource-gathering activity.

LEARNING:
  Starting location is Town Square in TOWN with access to 6 guilds (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers) and a Warehouse service.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Miners Guild"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Miners Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: none
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  I'm now in the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that gives 5 COPPER_ORE in exchange for 2 COPPER_BAR, plus 10 reputation. This seems like a crafting/trade contract - I'd need to make copper bars first. I should enrol in this guild to learn mining skills, which will likely allow me to gather copper ore that I can then smelt into bars.

LEARNING:
  Miners Guild has contracts. Contract miners-guild-1 requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 rep. Guild actions available are "enrol" and "leave".

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Mining guild (3t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  I enrolled in the Miners Guild and learned Mining L1 with FOCUS mode. I see APPRAISE unlocks at L3. Now I need to find a place to actually mine. I should explore other guilds and find mining locations. Let me leave and check the Explorers Guild - they might help me discover new areas where I can mine.

LEARNING:
  Enrolling costs 3 ticks. Mining skill has modes: FOCUS (unlocked at L1), APPRAISE (unlocks at L3). Skills show level and XP progress.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Miners Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections: none known

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  I'm back in Town Square with Mining L1 skill. I need to find a mining location to gather copper ore. The Explorers Guild seems like the logical place to discover new areas/connections. Let me visit there to see if I can unlock travel to mining areas.

LEARNING:
  Leaving a location costs 0 ticks. Town Square shows "Connections: none known" - I need to discover travel routes.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Explorers Guild"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Explorers Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

=== TICK 6 ===

REASONING:
  I'm in the Explorers Guild. I should enrol here to see what exploration skills or abilities I gain - this might help me discover new areas like mining locations. The enrol action is available.

LEARNING:
  Explorers Guild has enrol option like Miners Guild. No contracts visible here.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Exploration guild, discovered Greenmarsh Fields (31t travel time)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

=== TICK 6 ===

REASONING:
  I now have Exploration L1 skill. This should help me discover new areas. I need to leave the guild and find a way to explore/discover mining areas. Let me go back to Town Square and look for ways to use my exploration skill - maybe I can "explore" or "survey" from there, or find connections to other areas.

LEARNING:
  Exploration skill gained at L1. Enrolling always costs 3t. Now have 2 skills: Mining L1 and Exploration L1.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Explorers Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 31t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

=== TICK 42 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent! Now I can see a connection that wasn't visible before - "Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)" is 31 ticks away. The Exploration skill must have revealed this. This could be where I find mining resources. However, 31t is a significant travel time. Let me first try using "explore" or "survey" in Town Square to see if there are closer areas, or I should visit Smithing Guild to learn how to make COPPER_BAR before heading out to gather ore.

LEARNING:
  Exploration L1 reveals connections! Greenmarsh Fields is now visible at 31t travel time. Connections show "further from Town" suggesting there's a distance/hub system.

ACTION: Survey {"type":"Survey"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered Elderline Edge (21t travel time)
    +2 Exploration XP (23 to next level, 8% there)
    RNG: very unlucky (97% percentile) - took 36t, 23t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 21t - Elderline Edge (unexplored), 31t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

=== TICK 80 ===

REASONING:
  Survey gave me +2 Exploration XP and revealed a closer location - Elderline Edge at 21t, compared to Greenmarsh Fields at 31t. I should continue surveying to potentially find even closer areas and gain more exploration XP. The exploration skill seems to reveal more connections as I use it.

LEARNING:
  Survey costs 0t (or very little), gives +2 Exploration XP, and can reveal new closer connections. Elderline Edge (21t) is closer than Greenmarsh Fields (31t).

ACTION: Survey {"type":"Survey"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered Green Hollow (24t travel time)
    +2 Exploration XP (21 to next level, 16% there)
    RNG: very unlucky (100% percentile) - took 38t, 28t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 21t - Elderline Edge (unexplored), 24t - Green Hollow (unexplored), 31t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

=== TICK 80 ===

REASONING:
  Survey revealed another area - Green Hollow at 24t. But I notice a big jump from T6 to T42 - survey must have cost 36 ticks! That's expensive. I've now used 42 ticks total. I should stop surveying and make progress. I have three unexplored areas now. Before traveling far, let me check the Smithing Guild to learn how to make COPPER_BAR (needed for the miners guild contract).

LEARNING:
  Survey costs a LOT of time - about 36 ticks! It gives +2 Exploration XP and can reveal new connections. Don't overuse it. Green Hollow (24t) discovered.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Smithing Guild"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Smithing Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  Recipes: iron-bar (2 IRON_ORE, Smithing), copper-bar (2 COPPER_ORE, Smithing)
  
  Location: Smithing Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

=== TICK 83 ===

REASONING:
  I found the recipes I need! copper-bar requires 2 COPPER_ORE and Smithing skill. So my plan is now clear: 1) Enrol in Smithing to learn the skill, 2) Travel to a mining area to get COPPER_ORE, 3) Return and craft COPPER_BAR, 4) Complete the miners guild contract. Let me enrol here first.

LEARNING:
  Smithing Guild shows recipes automatically upon entering! copper-bar = 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill. iron-bar = 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing. Travel within Town took 38t (T42→T80) - that seems too long, maybe it was instant and the survey from before was being processed?

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Smithing guild (3t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  Recipes: iron-bar (2 IRON_ORE, Smithing), copper-bar (2 COPPER_ORE, Smithing)
  
  Location: Smithing Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

=== TICK 83 ===

REASONING:
  I now have Smithing L1! I can craft copper-bar with 2 COPPER_ORE. Now I need to find COPPER_ORE. I should travel to one of the unexplored areas to find a mining location. Elderline Edge is closest at 21t. Let me leave the guild and travel there.

LEARNING:
  Enrol confirmed at 3t cost. Now have 3 skills: Mining L1, Smithing L1, Exploration L1.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Smithing Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 21t - Elderline Edge (unexplored), 24t - Green Hollow (unexplored), 31t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

=== TICK 104 ===

REASONING:
  I'm back in Town Square at T83. Time to travel to Elderline Edge (21t) to find mining resources. This is the closest unexplored area. I need to find COPPER_ORE to craft copper-bar for the contract.

LEARNING:
  Leave action is instant (0t cost) - went from T80 to T83, which accounts for the 3t enrol cost.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Elderline Edge"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Elderline Edge (21t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Elderline Edge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 21t - Town

=== TICK 116 ===

REASONING:
  I've arrived at Elderline Edge at T104 (83+21). It's unexplored, so I need to use the explore action to discover what's here. Hopefully there's a mining location with COPPER_ORE.

LEARNING:
  Travel to Elderline Edge confirmed at 21t. Areas start unexplored and need the explore action to reveal their contents.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Greenmarsh Fields (20t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (20 to next level, 20% there)
    RNG: average (54% percentile) - took 12t, 1t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Elderline Edge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 21t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 20t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

=== TICK 132 ===

REASONING:
  Explore gave +1 Exploration XP but the area is still unexplored. I need to keep exploring to fully reveal it. The action also revealed a connection to Greenmarsh Fields (20t from here). Let me continue exploring.

LEARNING:
  Explore gives +1 Exploration XP and may need multiple uses to fully reveal an area. It also reveals connections to other areas.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered enemy camp (16t)
    +1 Exploration XP (19 to next level, 24% there)
    RNG: average (40% percentile) - took 16t, 5t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Elderline Edge **
  
  Fully explored!
  
  Enemy camps: enemy camp (difficulty 1)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 21t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 20t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

=== TICK 152 ===

REASONING:
  The area is now fully explored! It shows an enemy camp (difficulty 1) but no mining location. This is disappointing - I was hoping for a mine with COPPER_ORE. I should try a different unexplored area. Greenmarsh Fields is 20t from here, or I could go back to Town (21t) and try Green Hollow (24t). Greenmarsh Fields is closer from here, let me try that.

LEARNING:
  Elderline Edge has an enemy camp but NO mining resources. Explore takes ~12t per use (T104→T116 = 12t for one explore). Areas can have enemy camps which likely require combat.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Greenmarsh Fields"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Greenmarsh Fields (20t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenmarsh Fields **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 31t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 20t - Elderline Edge (fully explored)

=== TICK 154 ===

REASONING:
  I've arrived at Greenmarsh Fields at T132. It's unexplored, so I need to explore it to see what resources are here. Hoping to find a mining location with COPPER_ORE this time.

LEARNING:
  Travel from Elderline Edge to Greenmarsh Fields confirmed at 20t.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Green Hollow (41t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (18 to next level, 28% there)
    RNG: lucky (18% percentile) - took 2t, 9t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenmarsh Fields **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Connections closer to Town: 31t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 20t - Elderline Edge (fully explored), 41t - Green Hollow (unexplored)

=== TICK 242 ===

REASONING:
  Area is partly explored now. I can see a connection to Green Hollow (41t from here). Need to continue exploring to fully reveal what's in Greenmarsh Fields. Let me keep exploring.

LEARNING:
  First explore took 20t (T132→T152). "Partly explored" is an intermediate state between unexplored and fully explored.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Slate Ridge (20t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (17 to next level, 32% there)
    RNG: very unlucky (89% percentile) - took 88t, 48t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenmarsh Fields **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Connections closer to Town: 31t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 20t - Elderline Edge (fully explored), 41t - Green Hollow (unexplored)
  Connections further from Town: 20t - Slate Ridge (undiscovered)

=== TICK 280 ===

REASONING:
  Still partly explored, but now I can see another connection - Slate Ridge (20t, undiscovered, further from Town). Let me continue exploring to fully reveal Greenmarsh Fields.

LEARNING:
  Explore time varies - this one only took 2t (T152→T154). Exploring reveals more connections progressively. "Undiscovered" areas are different from "unexplored" - probably means I haven't been there at all yet.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Whisperline Span (26t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (16 to next level, 36% there)
    RNG: average (48% percentile) - took 38t, 2t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenmarsh Fields **
  
  Fully explored!
  
  Connections closer to Town: 31t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 20t - Elderline Edge (partly explored), 41t - Green Hollow (unexplored)
  Connections further from Town: 20t - Slate Ridge (undiscovered), 26t - Whisperline Span (undiscovered)

=== TICK 300 ===

REASONING:
  Greenmarsh Fields is now fully explored but... there's no mining location here either! Just like Elderline Edge, it seems to be an empty area with just connections to other places. That last explore took a long time (T154→T242 = 88t!). 
  
  I've now spent a lot of time exploring and haven't found any mining spots. Let me think about what areas might have resources:
  - Slate Ridge (20t from here, "undiscovered") - the name "Ridge" sounds like it might have mining
  - Green Hollow (41t from here) 
  - Whisperline Span (26t from here, "undiscovered")
  
  Slate Ridge sounds most promising for mining based on the name, and it's close (20t). Let me try there.

LEARNING:
  Greenmarsh Fields has NO resources - just a crossroads area. Explore time is highly variable (2t to 88t). Some explores take much longer than others. Areas named after terrain features might indicate what resources they have.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Slate Ridge"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Slate Ridge (discovered) (20t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Slate Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 20t - Greenmarsh Fields (fully explored)

=== TICK 334 ===

REASONING:
  I've arrived at Slate Ridge at T280. It's unexplored, so I need to explore it. The name "Slate Ridge" really sounds like a mining area - slate is a type of rock! Let's explore and hopefully find COPPER_ORE here.

LEARNING:
  Travel from Greenmarsh Fields to Slate Ridge took 20t as expected, arriving at T280.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Gray Meadow (30t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (15 to next level, 40% there)
    RNG: lucky (21% percentile) - took 34t, 126t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Slate Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Connections closer to Town: 20t - Greenmarsh Fields (fully explored)
  Connections at this distance: 30t - Gray Meadow (undiscovered)

=== TICK 408 ===

REASONING:
  Slate Ridge is partly explored. First explore took 20t (T280→T300). I can see a connection to Gray Meadow now. Need to keep exploring to fully reveal what's here - hoping for a mining location!

LEARNING:
  First explore at Slate Ridge took 20t. Found connection to Gray Meadow (30t away, undiscovered).

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered ore vein (74t)
    +1 Exploration XP (14 to next level, 44% there)
    RNG: average (47% percentile) - took 74t, 6t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Smithing L1, Exploration L1
  
  ** Slate Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
