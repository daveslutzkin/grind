================================================================================

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

--- CURRENT PROMPT ---
Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none

Location: Town Square in TOWN

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections: none known

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm starting a new game and know nothing about the world yet. I'm in the Town Square with access to several guilds and a warehouse. Since this is a resource gathering game, I should explore the guilds to understand what options are available. The Miners Guild seems like a good starting point since mining is typically a fundamental resource-gathering activity.

ACTION: go Miners Guild

LEARNING: Starting location is Town Square in TOWN with access to 6 guilds (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers) and a Warehouse service.

NOTES: Town Square has: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild, Warehouse. Starting to explore guilds.

Actions: enrol || leave

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm now in the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that gives 5 COPPER_ORE in exchange for 2 COPPER_BAR, plus 10 reputation. This seems like a crafting/trade contract - I'd need to make copper bars first. I should enrol in this guild to learn mining skills, which will likely allow me to gather copper ore that I can then smelt into bars.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: Miners Guild has contracts. Contract miners-guild-1 requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 rep. Guild actions available are "enrol" and "leave".

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.

Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:

LEARNING: Starting location is Town Square in TOWN with access to 6 guilds (Miners, Foresters, Combat, Smithing, Woodcrafters, Explorers) and a Warehouse service.

NOTES: Town Square has: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild, Warehouse. Starting to explore guilds.

[user]: Result: T0: TravelToLocation → OK

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now in the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that gives 5 COPPER_ORE in exchange for 2 COPPER_BAR, plus 10 reputation. This seems like a crafting/trade contract - I'd need to make copper bars first. I should enrol in this guild to learn mining skills, which will likely allow me to gather copper ore that I can then smelt into bars.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: Miners Guild has contracts. Contract miners-guild-1 requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE + 10 rep. Guild actions available are "enrol" and "leave".

NOTES: Town Square: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild, Warehouse.
Miners Guild: Contract miners-guild-1 (give 2 COPPER_BAR → get 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep). Can enrol here.

[assistant]: REASONING: I enrolled in the Miners Guild and learned Mining L1 with FOCUS mode. I see APPRAISE unlocks at L3. Now I need to find a place to actually mine. I should explore other guilds and find mining locations. Let me leave and check the Explorers Guild - they might help me discover new areas where I can mine.

ACTION: leave

LEARNING: Enrolling costs 3 ticks. Mining skill has modes: FOCUS (unlocked at L1), APPRAISE (unlocks at L3). Skills show level and XP progress.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

This could be where I find mining resources. However, 31t is a significant travel time.

[assistant]: REASONING: I enrolled in the Miners Guild and learned Mining L1 with FOCUS mode. I see APPRAISE unlocks at L3. Now I need to find a place to actually mine. I should explore other guilds and find mining locations. Let me leave and check the Explorers Guild - they might help me discover new areas where I can mine.

ACTION: leave

LEARNING: Enrolling costs 3 ticks. Mining skill has modes: FOCUS (unlocked at L1), APPRAISE (unlocks at L3). Skills show level and XP progress.

This could be where I find mining resources. However, 31t is a significant travel time. Let me first try using "explore" or "survey" in Town Square to see if there are closer areas, or I should visit Smithing Guild to learn how to make COPPER_BAR before heading out to gather ore.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

Connections further from Town: 21t - Elderline Edge (unexplored), 24t - Green Hollow (unexplored), 31t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey revealed another area - Green Hollow at 24t. But I notice a big jump from T6 to T42 - survey must have cost 36 ticks! That's expensive. I've now used 42 ticks total. I should stop surveying and make progress. I have three unexplored areas now. Before traveling far, let me check the Smithing Guild to learn how to make COPPER_BAR (needed for the miners guild contract).

ACTION: go Smithing Guild

LEARNING: Survey costs a LOT of time - about 36 ticks! It gives +2 Exploration XP and can reveal new connections. Don't overuse it. Green Hollow (24t) discovered.

NOTES: Town Square: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild, Warehouse.

Actions: enrol || leave

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I found the recipes I need! copper-bar requires 2 COPPER_ORE and Smithing skill. So my plan is now clear: 1) Enrol in Smithing to learn the skill, 2) Travel to a mining area to get COPPER_ORE, 3) Return and craft COPPER_BAR, 4) Complete the miners guild contract. Let me enrol here first.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: Smithing Guild shows recipes automatically upon entering! copper-bar = 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill. iron-bar = 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing. Travel within Town took 38t (T42→T80) - that seems too long, maybe it was instant and the survey from before was being processed?

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I now have Exploration L1 skill. This should help me discover new areas. I need to leave the guild and find a way to explore/discover mining areas. Let me go back to Town Square and look for ways to use my exploration skill - maybe I can "explore" or "survey" from there, or find connections to other areas.

ACTION: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! Now I can see a connection that wasn't visible before - "Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)" is 31 ticks away. The Exploration skill must have revealed this. This could be where I find mining resources. However, 31t is a significant travel time. Let me first try using "explore" or "survey" in Town Square to see if there are closer areas, or I should visit Smithing Guild to learn how to make COPPER_BAR before heading out to gather ore.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: Exploration L1 reveals connections! Greenmarsh Fields is now visible at 31t travel time. Connections show "further from Town" suggesting there's a distance/hub system.

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey gave me +2 Exploration XP and revealed a closer location - Elderline Edge at 21t, compared to Greenmarsh Fields at 31t. I should continue surveying to potentially find even closer areas and gain more exploration XP. The exploration skill seems to reveal more connections as I use it.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: Survey costs 0t (or very little), gives +2 Exploration XP, and can reveal new closer connections. Elderline Edge (21t) is closer than Greenmarsh Fields (31t).

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections further from Town: 21t - Elderline Edge (unexplored), 31t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey gave me +2 Exploration XP and revealed a closer location - Elderline Edge at 21t, compared to Greenmarsh Fields at 31t. I should continue surveying to potentially find even closer areas and gain more exploration XP. The exploration skill seems to reveal more connections as I use it.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: Survey costs 0t (or very little), gives +2 Exploration XP, and can reveal new closer connections. Elderline Edge (21t) is closer than Greenmarsh Fields (31t).

NOTES: Town Square: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild, Warehouse.

Connections further from Town: 21t - Elderline Edge (unexplored), 24t - Green Hollow (unexplored), 31t - Greenmarsh Fields (unexplored)

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey revealed another area - Green Hollow at 24t. But I notice a big jump from T6 to T42 - survey must have cost 36 ticks! That's expensive. I've now used 42 ticks total. I should stop surveying and make progress. I have three unexplored areas now. Before traveling far, let me check the Smithing Guild to learn how to make COPPER_BAR (needed for the miners guild contract).

ACTION: go Smithing Guild

LEARNING: Survey costs a LOT of time - about 36 ticks! It gives +2 Exploration XP and can reveal new connections. Don't overuse it. Green Hollow (24t) discovered.

Location: Smithing Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I found the recipes I need! copper-bar requires 2 COPPER_ORE and Smithing skill. So my plan is now clear: 1) Enrol in Smithing to learn the skill, 2) Travel to a mining area to get COPPER_ORE, 3) Return and craft COPPER_BAR, 4) Complete the miners guild contract. Let me enrol here first.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: Smithing Guild shows recipes automatically upon entering! copper-bar = 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill. iron-bar = 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing. Travel within Town took 38t (T42→T80) - that seems too long, maybe it was instant and the survey from before was being processed?

[assistant]: REASONING: I now have Smithing L1! I can craft copper-bar with 2 COPPER_ORE. Now I need to find COPPER_ORE. I should travel to one of the unexplored areas to find a mining location. Elderline Edge is closest at 21t. Let me leave the guild and travel there.

ACTION: leave

Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
Recipes: iron-bar (2 IRON_ORE, Smithing), copper-bar (2 COPPER_ORE, Smithing)

Location: Smithing Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I found the recipes I need! copper-bar requires 2 COPPER_ORE and Smithing skill. So my plan is now clear: 1) Enrol in Smithing to learn the skill, 2) Travel to a mining area to get COPPER_ORE, 3) Return and craft COPPER_BAR, 4) Complete the miners guild contract. Let me enrol here first.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: Smithing Guild shows recipes automatically upon entering! copper-bar = 2 COPPER_ORE + Smithing skill. iron-bar = 2 IRON_ORE + Smithing. Travel within Town took 38t (T42→T80) - that seems too long, maybe it was instant and the survey from before was being processed?

ACTION: go Elderline Edge

LEARNING: Leave action is instant (0t cost) - went from T80 to T83, which accounts for the 3t enrol cost.

[assistant]: REASONING: I've arrived at Elderline Edge at T104 (83+21). It's unexplored, so I need to use the explore action to discover what's here. Hopefully there's a mining location with COPPER_ORE.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Travel to Elderline Edge confirmed at 21t. Areas start unexplored and need the explore action to reveal their contents.

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: The area is now fully explored! It shows an enemy camp (difficulty 1) but no mining location. This is disappointing - I was hoping for a mine with COPPER_ORE. I should try a different unexplored area. Greenmarsh Fields is 20t from here, or I could go back to Town (21t) and try Green Hollow (24t). Greenmarsh Fields is closer from here, let me try that.

ACTION: go Greenmarsh Fields

LEARNING: Elderline Edge has an enemy camp but NO mining resources. Explore takes ~12t per use (T104→T116 = 12t for one explore). Areas can have enemy camps which likely require combat.

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.

You set CONTINUE_IF: area still unexplored

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

[assistant]: REASONING: The area is now fully explored! It shows an enemy camp (difficulty 1) but no mining location. This is disappointing - I was hoping for a mine with COPPER_ORE. I should try a different unexplored area. Greenmarsh Fields is 20t from here, or I could go back to Town (21t) and try Green Hollow (24t). Greenmarsh Fields is closer from here, let me try that.

ACTION: go Greenmarsh Fields

LEARNING: Elderline Edge has an enemy camp but NO mining resources. Explore takes ~12t per use (T104→T116 = 12t for one explore). Areas can have enemy camps which likely require combat.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

[assistant]: REASONING: Explore gave +1 Exploration XP but the area is still unexplored. I need to keep exploring to fully reveal it. The action also revealed a connection to Greenmarsh Fields (20t from here). Let me continue exploring.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Explore gives +1 Exploration XP and may need multiple uses to fully reveal an area. It also reveals connections to other areas.

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

[assistant]: REASONING: The area is now fully explored! It shows an enemy camp (difficulty 1) but no mining location. This is disappointing - I was hoping for a mine with COPPER_ORE. I should try a different unexplored area. Greenmarsh Fields is 20t from here, or I could go back to Town (21t) and try Green Hollow (24t). Greenmarsh Fields is closer from here, let me try that.

ACTION: go Greenmarsh Fields

LEARNING: Elderline Edge has an enemy camp but NO mining resources. Explore takes ~12t per use (T104→T116 = 12t for one explore). Areas can have enemy camps which likely require combat.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: First explore took 20t (T132→T152). "Partly explored" is an intermediate state between unexplored and fully explored.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Greenmarsh Fields is now fully explored but... there's no mining location here either! Just like Elderline Edge, it seems to be an empty area with just connections to other places. That last explore took a long time (T154→T242 = 88t!). 

I've now spent a lot of time exploring and haven't found any mining spots. Let me think about what areas might have resources:
- Slate Ridge (20t from here, "undiscovered") - the name "Ridge" sounds like it might have mining
- Green Hollow (41t from here) 
- Whisperline Span (26t from here, "undiscovered")

Slate Ridge sounds most promising for mining based on the name, and it's close (20t). Let me try there.

ACTION: go Slate Ridge

LEARNING: Greenmarsh Fields has NO resources - just a crossroads area. Explore time is highly variable (2t to 88t). Some explores take much longer than others. Areas named after terrain features might indicate what resources they have.

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

[assistant]: REASONING: Area is partly explored now. I can see a connection to Green Hollow (41t from here). Need to continue exploring to fully reveal what's in Greenmarsh Fields. Let me keep exploring.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: First explore took 20t (T132→T152). "Partly explored" is an intermediate state between unexplored and fully explored.

** Greenmarsh Fields **

Partly explored

Connections closer to Town: 31t - Town
Connections at this distance: 20t - Elderline Edge (fully explored), 41t - Green Hollow (unexplored)
Connections further from Town: 20t - Slate Ridge (undiscovered)

You set CONTINUE_IF: area still unexplored

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

[assistant]: REASONING: Still partly explored, but now I can see another connection - Slate Ridge (20t, undiscovered, further from Town). Let me continue exploring to fully reveal Greenmarsh Fields.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Explore time varies - this one only took 2t (T152→T154). Exploring reveals more connections progressively. "Undiscovered" areas are different from "unexplored" - probably means I haven't been there at all yet.

** Greenmarsh Fields **

Fully explored!

Connections closer to Town: 31t - Town
Connections at this distance: 20t - Elderline Edge (partly explored), 41t - Green Hollow (unexplored)
Connections further from Town: 20t - Slate Ridge (undiscovered), 26t - Whisperline Span (undiscovered)

You set CONTINUE_IF: area still unexplored

Should you continue with the same action, or do something else?

[assistant]: REASONING: Greenmarsh Fields is now fully explored but... there's no mining location here either! Just like Elderline Edge, it seems to be an empty area with just connections to other places. That last explore took a long time (T154→T242 = 88t!). 

I've now spent a lot of time exploring and haven't found any mining spots. Let me think about what areas might have resources:
- Slate Ridge (20t from here, "undiscovered") - the name "Ridge" sounds like it might have mining
- Green Hollow (41t from here) 
- Whisperline Span (26t from here, "undiscovered")

Slate Ridge sounds most promising for mining based on the name, and it's close (20t). Let me try there.

ACTION: go Slate Ridge

LEARNING: Greenmarsh Fields has NO resources - just a crossroads area. Explore time is highly variable (2t to 88t). Some explores take much longer than others. Areas named after terrain features might indicate what resources they have.

** Slate Ridge **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 20t - Greenmarsh Fields (fully explored)

[assistant]: REASONING: I've arrived at Slate Ridge at T280. It's unexplored, so I need to explore it. The name "Slate Ridge" really sounds like a mining area - slate is a type of rock! Let's explore and hopefully find COPPER_ORE here.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Travel from Greenmarsh Fields to Slate Ridge took 20t as expected, arriving at T280.
