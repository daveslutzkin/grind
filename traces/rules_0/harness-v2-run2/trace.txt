REASONING:
  I'm starting fresh in TOWN with 50 ticks and no skills or items. My first priority should be to understand the game mechanics by learning skills and exploring. The guild is likely in TOWN where I can enrol in skills. I should start by learning a basic skill like Gathering since this appears to be a resource-focused game.

ACTION: (no action)

RESULT:
  (no result)

LEARNING:
  Starting the game - need to discover what skills are available and their costs. Gathering seems like a fundamental skill for resource collection.

      - COPPER_ORE: 102/102 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 123/123 units [requires Mining L1]

REASONING:
  The enrol action didn't seem to work or provide feedback. This suggests either "Gathering" isn't the correct skill name, or I need to be more specific about the enrolment process. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I need to explore the town first to find the guild or see what's available here.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Move
  Parameters: destination=OUTSKIRTS_MINE
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 0)
  Changes: Moved from TOWN to OUTSKIRTS_MINE

LEARNING:
  The Enrol Gathering command didn't work - either the skill name is wrong or the action format needs adjustment. Moving to explore other locations to understand what's available and potentially find resource nodes to interact with.

    ANCIENT_GROVE (15 ticks)
  
  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Excellent! I've discovered mining nodes at OUTSKIRTS_MINE. I can see several ore veins with different materials (STONE, COPPER_ORE, TIN_ORE) and their quantities. The brackets show skill requirements - [MiningL1] for stone and copper, [MiningL2] for tin. I need to go back to town and enrol in Mining first before I can gather from these nodes.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"TOWN"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Move
  Parameters: destination=TOWN
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 3)
  Changes: Moved from OUTSKIRTS_MINE to TOWN

LEARNING:
  Found mining nodes! Each node shows material types, current/max quantities, and skill requirements in brackets. STONE and COPPER_ORE require MiningL1, while TIN_ORE requires MiningL2. Need to enrol in Mining skill first before gathering.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Now I'm back in TOWN and need to enrol in the Mining skill so I can gather from those ore veins I discovered. Based on what I saw, Mining seems to be the correct skill name since the nodes showed [MiningL1] and [MiningL2] requirements.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Mining"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Enrol
  Parameters: skill=Mining
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 6)
  Changes: Enrolled in Mining guild

LEARNING:
  Successfully moved between locations - travel costs match the reference (3 ticks each way between TOWN and OUTSKIRTS_MINE). Need to learn the correct skill name format for enrolment.

      - COPPER_ORE: 102/102 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 123/123 units [requires Mining L1]

REASONING:
  Perfect! I successfully enrolled in Mining for 3 ticks and now have Mining:L1(0xp). I can see I have access to FOCUS mode for gathering, and will unlock APPRAISE mode at L3. Now I should return to OUTSKIRTS_MINE to start gathering resources. I'll focus on STONE or COPPER_ORE since they only require MiningL1.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Move
  Parameters: destination=OUTSKIRTS_MINE
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 9)
  Changes: Moved from TOWN to OUTSKIRTS_MINE

LEARNING:
  Enrol action costs 3 ticks and gives L1 in the skill with 0 experience. Skills show available gather modes - I have FOCUS mode now and will get APPRAISE at L3. Ready to start resource gathering!

      - COPPER_ORE: 102/102 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 123/123 units [requires Mining L1]

REASONING:
  Now I'm back at the mining nodes with Mining:L1 skill. I can gather STONE and COPPER_ORE since they require MiningL1. I'll start with FOCUS mode on COPPER_ORE from node 0 since copper ore might be more valuable than stone. FOCUS mode requires specifying a material ID.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"COPPER_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=FOCUS, focusMaterialId=COPPER_ORE
  Time used: 5 ticks (at tick 12)
  Changes: Focused extraction of 4 COPPER_ORE
  
  Items gained:
    +4x COPPER_ORE
    (0.6 units wasted from inefficiency)
    Collateral damage to other materials:
      STONE: -1 units
      TIN_ORE: -1 units
  
  XP gained: +5 Mining
  
  LEVEL UP!
    Mining: 1 -> 2

LEARNING:
  Successfully returned to mining location. Ready to test gathering mechanics with FOCUS mode on a specific material that matches my skill level.

      - COPPER_ORE: 102/102 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 123/123 units [requires Mining L1]

REASONING:
  Excellent! Gathering worked perfectly. I got 4 COPPER_ORE and 5 Mining XP, which leveled me up to Mining:L2 with 1 additional XP (5 XP = 1 level + 1 overflow). The gather cost 5 ticks. Node quantities decreased: COPPER_ORE from 73 to 69 (-4) and STONE from 93 to 92 (-1), plus TIN_ORE from 49 to 48 (-1). Now that I'm L2, I can try gathering TIN_ORE which requires MiningL2.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"TIN_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=FOCUS, focusMaterialId=TIN_ORE
  Time used: 5 ticks (at tick 17)
  Changes: Focused extraction of 4 TIN_ORE
  
  Items gained:
    +4x TIN_ORE
    (0.6 units wasted from inefficiency)
    Collateral damage to other materials:
      STONE: -1 units
      COPPER_ORE: -1 units
  
  XP gained: +10 Mining
  
  LEVEL UP!
    Mining: 2 -> 3

LEARNING:
  FOCUS gathering costs 5 ticks, gives focused material plus bonus XP that can level up skills. Gathering reduces multiple materials from the same node simultaneously, not just the focused one. Mining L2 unlocked - can now access TIN_ORE nodes.

      - COPPER_ORE: 102/102 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 123/123 units [requires Mining L1]

REASONING:
  Great! TIN_ORE gathering gave me 4 TIN_ORE and 10 Mining XP, leveling me to L3 with 2 overflow XP. I now have APPRAISE mode unlocked and will get CAREFUL_ALL at L4. The node still has materials (TIN_ORE: 44/49), and my inventory isn't full (2/20 slots used). I should continue gathering TIN_ORE since it seems to give more XP than copper ore (10 vs 5), which will help me level up faster.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"TIN_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=FOCUS, focusMaterialId=TIN_ORE
  Time used: 5 ticks (at tick 22)
  Changes: Focused extraction of 5 TIN_ORE
  
  Items gained:
    +5x TIN_ORE
    (0.5333 units wasted from inefficiency)
    Collateral damage to other materials:
      STONE: -1 units
      COPPER_ORE: -1 units
  
  XP gained: +10 Mining

LEARNING:
  TIN_ORE gives double the XP of COPPER_ORE (10 vs 5), making it more efficient for skill leveling. Mining L3 unlocked APPRAISE mode, and L4 will unlock CAREFUL_ALL. Higher-tier materials seem to give more XP.

      - STONE: 123/123 units [requires Mining L1]

REASONING:
  Got 5 TIN_ORE this time (instead of 4) and 10 XP again, now at L3(12xp). The yield seems to vary slightly. The node still has TIN_ORE (39/49) and my inventory isn't full (2/20 slots). I should try the new APPRAISE mode to see what it does - it might give me information about the node or different yields.

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=APPRAISE
  Time used: 1 ticks (at tick 27)
  Changes: Appraised node OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0
  
  Node appraisal - OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0 (ORE_VEIN):
    STONE: 90/93 units (97%) tier 1 [requires Mining L1]
    COPPER_ORE: 67/73 units (92%) tier 1 [requires Mining L1]
    TIN_ORE: 39/49 units (80%) tier 2 [requires Mining L2]

LEARNING:
  Yield can vary - got 5 TIN_ORE this time vs 4 last time, but XP stayed consistent at 10. Should test the newly unlocked APPRAISE mode to understand its mechanics.

      - COPPER_ORE: 102/102 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 123/123 units [requires Mining L1]

REASONING:
  Interesting! APPRAISE mode only cost 1 tick (much less than FOCUS's 5 ticks) but gave no materials or XP. It seems to be purely informational, though I don't see any obvious changes in the display. Maybe it reveals hidden information or affects future gathering efficiency. Since it was cheap, I'll continue with FOCUS gathering on TIN_ORE to build up resources and XP.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"TIN_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=FOCUS, focusMaterialId=TIN_ORE
  Time used: 5 ticks (at tick 28)
  Changes: Focused extraction of 5 TIN_ORE
  
  Items gained:
    +5x TIN_ORE
    (0.5333 units wasted from inefficiency)
    Collateral damage to other materials:
      STONE: -1 units
      COPPER_ORE: -1 units
  
  XP gained: +10 Mining
  
  LEVEL UP!
    Mining: 3 -> 4

LEARNING:
  APPRAISE mode costs only 1 tick vs FOCUS's 5 ticks, gives no materials or XP, but may provide hidden information about nodes. It's a cheap scouting action.

REASONING:
  Excellent! I leveled up to Mining:L4 and unlocked CAREFUL_ALL mode. Got 5 TIN_ORE and 10 XP again. I should test the new CAREFUL_ALL mode to see what it does - it might gather all available materials from a node or have some other special effect. My inventory is still not full (2/20 slots) and the node has materials remaining.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0","mode":"CAREFUL_ALL"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=CAREFUL_ALL
  Time used: 10 ticks (at tick 33)
  Changes: Carefully extracted 5 STONE, 5 COPPER_ORE, 5 TIN_ORE
  
  Items gained:
    +5x STONE
    +5x COPPER_ORE
    +5x TIN_ORE
  
  XP gained: +13 Mining

LEARNING:
  Reached Mining L4 and unlocked CAREFUL_ALL mode. Consistent 5 TIN_ORE and 10 XP yields with FOCUS mode. Ready to test the new gathering mode to understand its mechanics.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Fantastic discovery! CAREFUL_ALL gathers all materials from the node simultaneously - got 5 of each (STONE, COPPER_ORE, TIN_ORE) and 13 XP total. It costs 5 ticks like FOCUS but is more efficient for collecting everything. With only 7 ticks remaining and my inventory getting full (3/20 slots used but with large stacks), I should head back to TOWN to store my materials and see what's available there.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"TOWN"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Move
  Parameters: destination=TOWN
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 43)
  Changes: Moved from OUTSKIRTS_MINE to TOWN

LEARNING:
  CAREFUL_ALL mode gathers all available materials from a node simultaneously (5 each of STONE, COPPER_ORE, TIN_ORE) and gives more total XP (13 vs 10). It's the most efficient gathering method when you want all materials. Takes 5 ticks like FOCUS mode.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  I'm at TOWN with only 4 ticks remaining. I need to store my materials to free up inventory space and see what facilities are available. The Store action should allow me to put items in storage. I'll store some of my materials to prepare for future sessions.

ACTION: Store {"type":"Store","quantity":9,"itemId":"COPPER_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=COPPER_ORE, quantity=9
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 46)
  Changes: Stored 9 COPPER_ORE

LEARNING:
  Successfully reached TOWN. With very limited ticks remaining, I should focus on storing materials and exploring what services are available in town for future planning.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Good! Storage system works and freed up an inventory slot. I have 4 ticks left - enough for one more action. I should store my other materials as well to prepare for the next session, or explore what other facilities are available in TOWN. Let me store the TIN_ORE since I have a lot of it.

ACTION: Store {"type":"Store","quantity":19,"itemId":"TIN_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=TIN_ORE, quantity=19
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 46)
  Changes: Stored 19 TIN_ORE

LEARNING:
  Store action works efficiently - took no extra time beyond the base action cost. Storage system allows me to preserve materials between sessions. Should continue storing to free up inventory space.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Excellent! Store action doesn't cost any ticks - it happened at T46 again. This is very useful for inventory management. I have 4 ticks left and only 5xSTONE in inventory. I should store this too and then see what other facilities or options are available in TOWN with my remaining ticks.

ACTION: Store {"type":"Store","quantity":5,"itemId":"STONE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=STONE, quantity=5
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 46)
  Changes: Stored 5 STONE

LEARNING:
  Store actions are free (no tick cost) - very important for efficient inventory management. Can store items without wasting precious time. Storage persists between sessions, making it safe to store valuable resources.

REASONING:
  Perfect! My inventory is now empty and all materials are safely stored. I have 4 ticks remaining and I'm in TOWN. This is a good opportunity to explore what other facilities or services are available here. I should see if there are other skills to enrol in, contracts to accept, or other town features I haven't discovered yet. Let me try to see if there are other skills available at the guild.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Smithing"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Enrol
  Parameters: skill=Smithing
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 46)
  Changes: Enrolled in Smithing guild

LEARNING:
  Store actions are completely free - all three store operations happened at T46. This makes inventory management very efficient. Now I should explore what other skills or services are available in TOWN with my remaining ticks.
