--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm starting fresh in a town square with no skills, empty inventory, and no known connections to other areas. I can see multiple guilds available, each likely teaching different skills. Since this is a resource gathering and progression game, I should start by learning a skill that will allow me to gather basic resources. The Miners Guild and Foresters Guild seem like good starting points for gathering materials. Let me explore what the Miners Guild offers first, as mining often provides fundamental crafting materials in these types of games.

ACTION: Go to Miners Guild

LEARNING: This is my first action, so no previous results to learn from yet.

NOTES: 
- Starting location: Town Square
- Available guilds: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild

Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild and can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to give me 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. However, I don't have any copper bars yet. The guild shows I can either "enrol" (presumably to learn mining skills) or "leave". Since I need to learn mining to gather materials, I should enrol first to unlock the Mining skill.

ACTION: Enrol Mining

LEARNING: Travel actions appear to cost 0 ticks (T0 shown). I discovered there are contracts at guilds that trade items for other items plus reputation. This particular contract wants refined materials (copper bars) in exchange for raw materials (copper ore), which seems backwards - usually you'd expect to trade raw for refined.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Great! I successfully learned Mining at Level 1, which cost 3 ticks. I can see it has a [FOCUS] ability available now, and will unlock APPRAISE when I reach Level 3. Now I need to find mining nodes to actually gather resources. Since I'm at the guild and can only "leave" now, I should go back to the town square and then explore to find mining areas or nodes.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Enrolling in a skill costs 3 ticks and gives you Level 1 in that skill. Mining L1 gives [FOCUS] ability immediately, with APPRAISE unlocking at L3. After enrolling, the only action available is to leave the guild.

REASONING: I'm back at the town square with Mining L1 skill but still no connections to other areas where I might find mining nodes.

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none

Location: Town Square in TOWN

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections: none known

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm starting fresh in a town square with no skills, empty inventory, and no known connections to other areas. I can see multiple guilds available, each likely teaching different skills. Since this is a resource gathering and progression game, I should start by learning a skill that will allow me to gather basic resources. The Miners Guild and Foresters Guild seem like good starting points for gathering materials. Let me explore what the Miners Guild offers first, as mining often provides fundamental crafting materials in these types of games.

ACTION: Go to Miners Guild

LEARNING: This is my first action, so no previous results to learn from yet.

NOTES: 
- Starting location: Town Square
- Available guilds: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
- Services: Warehouse (likely for storage)

[user]: Result: T0: TravelToLocation → OK

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild and can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to give me 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. However, I don't have any copper bars yet. The guild shows I can either "enrol" (presumably to learn mining skills) or "leave". Since I need to learn mining to gather materials, I should enrol first to unlock the Mining skill.

ACTION: Enrol Mining

LEARNING: Travel actions appear to cost 0 ticks (T0 shown). I discovered there are contracts at guilds that trade items for other items plus reputation. This particular contract wants refined materials (copper bars) in exchange for raw materials (copper ore), which seems backwards - usually you'd expect to trade raw for refined.

NOTES:
- Starting location: Town Square
- Available guilds: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
- Services: Warehouse (likely for storage)

Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I successfully learned Mining at Level 1, which cost 3 ticks. I can see it has a [FOCUS] ability available now, and will unlock APPRAISE when I reach Level 3. Now I need to find mining nodes to actually gather resources. Since I'm at the guild and can only "leave" now, I should go back to the town square and then explore to find mining areas or nodes.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Enrolling in a skill costs 3 ticks and gives you Level 1 in that skill. Mining L1 gives [FOCUS] ability immediately, with APPRAISE unlocking at L3. After enrolling, the only action available is to leave the guild.

NOTES:
- Starting location: Town Square

Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections: none known

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm back at the town square with Mining L1 skill but still no connections to other areas where I might find mining nodes. I need to discover connections to wilderness areas that contain resource nodes. The Explorers Guild might be key here - they likely teach exploration skills or provide information about discovering new areas. Let me visit the Explorers Guild to see what they offer.

ACTION: Go to Explorers Guild

LEARNING: Leaving a guild location costs 0 ticks and returns me to the town square. I now have 3 ticks elapsed total from enrolling.

Actions: enrol || leave

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm at the Explorers Guild and can see the same pattern as the Miners Guild - I can either enrol to learn exploration skills or leave. Since I need to discover connections to other areas where I can find mining nodes, learning exploration skills seems essential. This will likely unlock abilities to discover new areas or connections.

ACTION: Enrol Exploration

LEARNING: The Explorers Guild follows the same pattern as other guilds - offering enrol or leave options. Travel between guilds within town continues to cost 0 ticks.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm at the Explorers Guild and can see the same pattern as the Miners Guild - I can either enrol to learn exploration skills or leave. Since I need to discover connections to other areas where I can find mining nodes, learning exploration skills seems essential. This will likely unlock abilities to discover new areas or connections.

ACTION: Enrol Exploration

LEARNING: The Explorers Guild follows the same pattern as other guilds - offering enrol or leave options. Travel between guilds within town continues to cost 0 ticks.

NOTES:
- Starting location: Town Square
- Available guilds: Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
- Services: Warehouse (likely for storage)
- Inventory capacity: 20 slots
- Discovered contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep) - seems to trade refined for raw
- Travel appears to cost 0 ticks within town, enrolling costs 3t
- Skills learned: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
- Need to find mining nodes to gather resources - may need to explore to discover area connections

[user]: Result: T3: Enrol Exploration → 3t

[user]: Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1

Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! I now have Exploration L1 in addition to Mining L1, costing another 3 ticks (total 6t elapsed). With exploration skills, I should now be able to discover connections to other areas. Let me leave the guild and return to the town square to see if any new options or connections have become available with my Exploration skill.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Enrolling in Exploration also costs 3 ticks and gives Level 1. Unlike Mining which showed specific abilities, Exploration L1 doesn't show any explicit abilities in brackets, but it likely unlocks the ability to discover area connections.

REASONING: Perfect! Now that I have Exploration L1, I can see a connection has appeared: "Greenhold Wood (unexplored)" which is 43 ticks away from Town. This is likely a wilderness area where I can find mining nodes and other resources. Since I need to gather materials to progress, I should travel to Greenhold Wood to explore what's available there.

ACTION: Go to Greenhold Wood

LEARNING: Having Exploration L1 skill reveals area connections that weren't visible before. The connection shows travel time (43t) and exploration status (unexplored). This suggests exploration skills unlock the ability to discover and travel to wilderness areas.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I successfully learned Mining at Level 1, which cost 3 ticks. I can see it has a [FOCUS] ability available now, and will unlock APPRAISE when I reach Level 3. Now I need to find mining nodes to actually gather resources. Since I'm at the guild and can only "leave" now, I should go back to the town square and then explore to find mining areas or nodes.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Enrolling in a skill costs 3 ticks and gives you Level 1 in that skill. Mining L1 gives [FOCUS] ability immediately, with APPRAISE unlocking at L3. After enrolling, the only action available is to leave the guild.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I've arrived at Greenhold Wood after 43 ticks of travel (now at 49t total). This is an unexplored area, and I can see it suggests using an "explore action to start". This must be how I discover what resources, nodes, or features are available in this wilderness area. Let me explore to see what's here.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: The game state hasn't changed, which suggests "Explore" isn't the correct action format. Looking at the available action types, I don't see "Explore" listed. However, I do see that some actions work for locations within an area, and there might be a specific way to explore. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I need to use "Go" to explore, or there's a specific exploration command I'm missing. Let me try "Go explore" or just wait to see if there are other options.

ACTION: Go explore

LEARNING: "Explore" by itself doesn't seem to be a valid action command. Need to figure out the correct way to explore unexplored areas.
