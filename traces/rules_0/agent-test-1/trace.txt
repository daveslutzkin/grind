TRACE LOG

=== TICK 0 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: none
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

REASONING:
  I'm starting fresh in a town square with no skills, empty inventory, and no known connections to other areas. I can see multiple guilds available, each likely teaching different skills. Since this is a resource gathering and progression game, I should start by learning a skill that will allow me to gather basic resources. The Miners Guild and Foresters Guild seem like good starting points for gathering materials. Let me explore what the Miners Guild offers first, as mining often provides fundamental crafting materials in these types of games.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_MINERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Miners Guild

LEARNING:
  This is my first action, so no previous results to learn from yet.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

REASONING:
  I'm now at the Miners Guild and can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to give me 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. However, I don't have any copper bars yet. The guild shows I can either "enrol" (presumably to learn mining skills) or "leave". Since I need to learn mining to gather materials, I should enrol first to unlock the Mining skill.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Mining"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Mining guild (3t)

LEARNING:
  Travel actions appear to cost 0 ticks (T0 shown). I discovered there are contracts at guilds that trade items for other items plus reputation. This particular contract wants refined materials (copper bars) in exchange for raw materials (copper ore), which seems backwards - usually you'd expect to trade raw for refined.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections: none known

REASONING:
  Great! I successfully learned Mining at Level 1, which cost 3 ticks. I can see it has a [FOCUS] ability available now, and will unlock APPRAISE when I reach Level 3. Now I need to find mining nodes to actually gather resources. Since I'm at the guild and can only "leave" now, I should go back to the town square and then explore to find mining areas or nodes.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Miners Guild for Town Square

LEARNING:
  Enrolling in a skill costs 3 ticks and gives you Level 1 in that skill. Mining L1 gives [FOCUS] ability immediately, with APPRAISE unlocking at L3. After enrolling, the only action available is to leave the guild.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

REASONING:
  I'm back at the town square with Mining L1 skill but still no connections to other areas where I might find mining nodes. I need to discover connections to wilderness areas that contain resource nodes. The Explorers Guild might be key here - they likely teach exploration skills or provide information about discovering new areas. Let me visit the Explorers Guild to see what they offer.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_EXPLORERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Explorers Guild

LEARNING:
  Leaving a guild location costs 0 ticks and returns me to the town square. I now have 3 ticks elapsed total from enrolling.

=== TICK 6 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

REASONING:
  I'm at the Explorers Guild and can see the same pattern as the Miners Guild - I can either enrol to learn exploration skills or leave. Since I need to discover connections to other areas where I can find mining nodes, learning exploration skills seems essential. This will likely unlock abilities to discover new areas or connections.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Exploration"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Exploration guild, discovered Greenhold Wood (43t travel time)

LEARNING:
  The Explorers Guild follows the same pattern as other guilds - offering enrol or leave options. Travel between guilds within town continues to cost 0 ticks.

=== TICK 6 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 43t - Greenhold Wood (unexplored)

REASONING:
  Excellent! I now have Exploration L1 in addition to Mining L1, costing another 3 ticks (total 6t elapsed). With exploration skills, I should now be able to discover connections to other areas. Let me leave the guild and return to the town square to see if any new options or connections have become available with my Exploration skill.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Explorers Guild for Town Square

LEARNING:
  Enrolling in Exploration also costs 3 ticks and gives Level 1. Unlike Mining which showed specific abilities, Exploration L1 doesn't show any explicit abilities in brackets, but it likely unlocks the ability to discover area connections.

=== TICK 49 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenhold Wood **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 43t - Town

REASONING:
  Perfect! Now that I have Exploration L1, I can see a connection has appeared: "Greenhold Wood (unexplored)" which is 43 ticks away from Town. This is likely a wilderness area where I can find mining nodes and other resources. Since I need to gather materials to progress, I should travel to Greenhold Wood to explore what's available there.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"area-d1-i0"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Greenhold Wood (43t)

LEARNING:
  Having Exploration L1 skill reveals area connections that weren't visible before. The connection shows travel time (43t) and exploration status (unexplored). This suggests exploration skills unlock the ability to discover and travel to wilderness areas.

=== TICK 49 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenhold Wood **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 43t - Town

REASONING:
  I've arrived at Greenhold Wood after 43 ticks of travel (now at 49t total). This is an unexplored area, and I can see it suggests using an "explore action to start". This must be how I discover what resources, nodes, or features are available in this wilderness area. Let me explore to see what's here.

ACTION: (no action)

RESULT:
  (no result)

LEARNING:
  Travel between areas takes significant time (43t to Greenhold Wood). Wilderness areas start as "unexplored" and require an explore action to reveal their contents. The connection back to Town shows the same 43t travel time.

=== TICK 49 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenhold Wood **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 43t - Town

REASONING:
  The game state hasn't changed, which suggests "Explore" isn't the correct action format. Looking at the available action types, I don't see "Explore" listed. However, I do see that some actions work for locations within an area, and there might be a specific way to explore. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I need to use "Go" to explore, or there's a specific exploration command I'm missing. Let me try "Go explore" or just wait to see if there are other options.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_EXPLORERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Unknown location!

LEARNING:
  "Explore" by itself doesn't seem to be a valid action command. Need to figure out the correct way to explore unexplored areas.
