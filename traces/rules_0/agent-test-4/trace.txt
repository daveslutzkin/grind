=== TICK 0 ===

REASONING:
  I'm starting fresh in this text-based resource gathering game. I have no skills, an empty inventory, and I'm in the Town Square with several guild options and a warehouse. My first priority is to understand the game world and what's available.
  
  Let me think about the best approach:
  1. I should explore the available guilds to understand what skills/activities exist
  2. The Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild would likely teach me gathering/combat
  3. The Smithing Guild and Woodcrafters Guild would likely teach crafting
  4. The Explorers Guild might teach exploration or provide information
  5. The Warehouse might store resources
  
  I'll start by exploring a guild to learn about the game mechanics. The Miners Guild seems like a good starting point since resource gathering is core to this type of game.

LEARNING:
  None yet - this is my first action.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_MINERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Miners Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: none
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see:
  1. There's a contract available: miners-guild-1 that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation
  2. I have two action options: enrol or leave
  
  This contract is interesting - it seems backwards from typical resource gathering (usually you'd give ore to get bars). This might be a smelting or crafting contract. But I don't have any copper bars yet, so I can't do this contract now.
  
  The key action is "enrol" - this likely teaches me mining skills or gives me access to mining activities. I should enrol to learn what mining entails and gain the ability to gather resources.

LEARNING:
  The Miners Guild has a contract system. Contract "miners-guild-1" requires 2 COPPER_BAR as input to produce 5 COPPER_ORE and grants +10 reputation. This suggests crafting/smelting mechanics exist.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Mining guild (3t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  Great! I've enrolled in Mining and gained:
  - Mining L1 skill with a [FOCUS] mode
  - APPRAISE ability (unlocks at L3)
  - Cost: 3 ticks
  
  Now I understand the skill system better. The Mining L1 has a FOCUS mode, which likely means I can use the mine action with "focus" parameter. The APPRAISE ability will unlock at L3.
  
  To actually mine, I need to go to a location with mining nodes. The Miners Guild is where I learn, but I need to find actual ore deposits. I should leave and explore to find mining locations. Let me check other guilds first to understand the full game, or I could try to explore from the Town Square to find mining areas.
  
  I'll leave and return to Town Square to explore further.

LEARNING:
  - Enrolling in a guild costs ticks (3t for Mining)
  - Skills have levels and unlock abilities at certain levels (APPRAISE at L3)
  - Skills have modes like [FOCUS]
  - The mine action takes parameters like focus, careful_all, or appraise

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Miners Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections: none known

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  I'm back at Town Square with Mining L1 skill. Now I need to find mining locations where I can actually gather copper ore. I have a few options:
  
  1. Explore the Explorers Guild - this might teach exploration or reveal new areas
  2. Use the "explore" action at Town Square to discover new locations
  3. Visit other guilds to understand the full skill system before committing
  
  Since I need to find mining nodes/areas, the Explorers Guild seems most relevant. However, "explore" as an action might also reveal new locations directly. Let me try exploring from Town Square first - this is likely free or low-cost and will reveal what areas exist beyond the Town Square.

LEARNING:
  I should discover what areas exist in the game world.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Not in Exploration Guild!

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections: none known

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  The explore action failed because I'm not in the Explorers Guild. This tells me that "explore" is a guild-specific action, not a general action. I need to enrol in the Explorers Guild to use the explore action.
  
  However, I have limited ticks and need to be strategic. Let me think about what I know:
  - I have Mining L1 and can mine (with focus mode)
  - But I haven't found any mining locations yet
  - The Explorers Guild might help me find locations
  
  I should go to the Explorers Guild and enrol to gain exploration capabilities. This will likely help me discover mining areas.

LEARNING:
  The "explore" action requires enrolment in the Explorers Guild - skills/actions are guild-specific.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_EXPLORERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Explorers Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

=== TICK 6 ===

REASONING:
  I'm at the Explorers Guild. I can enrol to gain exploration abilities. This will cost some ticks (likely 3 like Mining did), but it should give me the ability to discover new areas where I can actually mine.
  
  The trade-off: spending ticks now to enrol, but gaining the ability to find mining locations. This seems worthwhile since I can't effectively gather resources without knowing where to go.

LEARNING:
  Testing if Explorers Guild enrolment will give me exploration abilities similar to how Miners Guild gave me Mining L1.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Exploration guild, discovered Greenhold Verge (12t travel time)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

=== TICK 6 ===

REASONING:
  Perfect! I've enrolled in Exploration and gained Exploration L1 skill, costing 3 ticks. Now I have:
  - Mining L1 [FOCUS]
  - Exploration L1
  
  Total ticks used: 6
  
  Now I should leave and go back to Town Square, then use the "explore" action to discover new areas with mining nodes. This will allow me to find resources to gather.

LEARNING:
  Explorers Guild enrolment costs 3 ticks and grants Exploration L1 skill, similar to Mining enrolment.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Explorers Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 12t - Greenhold Verge (unexplored)

=== TICK 10 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent! Now I can see a new connection has appeared:
  - 12 ticks to Greenhold Verge (unexplored)
  
  This is likely a mining area! The Exploration skill revealed this connection. Now I have two options:
  
  1. Travel 12 ticks to Greenhold Verge to find mining nodes
  2. Use "explore" action again to discover more areas
  
  Given that I have limited ticks (started with some budget), I should be strategic. But I need to find actual mining nodes to progress. Greenhold Verge sounds like a promising location (possibly a green area with forestry/mining).
  
  However, before I commit 12 ticks to travel, let me try "explore" action here to see if it reveals more areas or gives me information about Greenhold Verge.

LEARNING:
  The Exploration skill reveals connections to new areas from the current location.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Timber Edge (39t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (24 to next level, 4% there)
    RNG: lucky (17% percentile) - took 4t, 49t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 12t - Greenhold Verge (unexplored), 39t - Timber Edge (undiscovered)

=== TICK 22 ===

REASONING:
  Great! The explore action gained me +1 Exploration XP and discovered a new area:
  - 39t - Timber Edge (undiscovered)
  
  So "explore" is a skill-leveling action that also reveals new connections. I now have two options:
  1. 12t to Greenhold Verge (unexplored)
  2. 39t to Timber Edge (undiscovered)
  
  Greenhold Verge is closer and likely has mining resources given the name. Timber Edge sounds forestry-focused (39t is quite far).
  
  I should travel to Greenhold Verge now. This will cost 12 ticks, bringing my total to 18 ticks used. Once there, I can mine copper ore with my Mining L1 [FOCUS] skill.

LEARNING:
  The "explore" action provides +1 XP to Exploration skill and reveals new area connections. Multiple connections can exist from one location.

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"area-d1-i0"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Far traveled to Greenhold Verge (1 hop) (12t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenhold Verge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 12t - Town

=== TICK 42 ===

REASONING:
  I've arrived at Greenhold Verge after spending 12 ticks on travel. Total ticks used: 6 + 12 = 18.
  
  The location says "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" - this means I need to use the explore action here to discover what's available at this location. This will reveal mining nodes, resources, NPCs, etc.

LEARNING:
  New locations require an "explore" action to reveal their contents and available resources.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered tree stand (20t)
    +1 Exploration XP (23 to next level, 8% there)
    RNG: lucky (17% percentile) - took 20t, 380t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenhold Verge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Tree stand (requires Woodcutting - Foresters Guild)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 12t - Town

=== TICK 90 ===

REASONING:
  Greenhold Verge is partly explored and shows:
  - Tree stand (requires Woodcutting skill from Foresters Guild)
  
  This is a forestry location, not a mining location. I need to find copper ore to mine. Let me continue exploring this area to see if there are more resources, or I should go back and try Timber Edge.
  
  Actually, wait - I should use "explore" again here to continue exploring, as it says "Partly explored". This might reveal more resources at this location.

LEARNING:
  Locations can be "partly explored" and require multiple explore actions to fully reveal all resources. Greenhold Verge is a forestry area with trees but no mining nodes visible yet.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Stone Ridge (33t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (22 to next level, 12% there)
    RNG: lucky (34% percentile) - took 48t, 32t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenhold Verge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Tree stand (requires Woodcutting - Foresters Guild)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 12t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 33t - Stone Ridge (undiscovered)

=== TICK 90 ===

REASONING:
  Good! The second explore action revealed a new connection:
  - 33t - Stone Ridge (undiscovered)
  
  Stone Ridge sounds like a mining location! That's perfect for finding copper ore.
  
  Current situation:
  - Ticks used: 42
  - I need to find copper ore to mine
  - Stone Ridge (33t away) is likely a mining area based on the name
  - Greenhold Verge only has trees (forestry)
  
  I should travel to Stone Ridge now. This will cost 33 ticks, bringing total to 75 ticks used.

LEARNING:
  Exploring partly explored locations reveals additional connections to new areas.

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"area-d1-i4"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Area not known!

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Greenhold Verge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Tree stand (requires Woodcutting - Foresters Guild)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 12t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 33t - Stone Ridge (undiscovered)

=== TICK 123 ===

REASONING:
  Ah! The fartravel action failed with AREA_NOT_KNOWN. This means I can't use fartravel to go to undiscovered areas - I need to use regular travel through the connection path.
  
  Since Stone Ridge is 33t away from Greenhold Verge, I need to use "go" action with the location name or find the proper travel path.
  
  Actually, looking at the connection "33t - Stone Ridge (undiscovered)" - the undiscovered status might mean I can't travel there yet. Let me try using "go" with the connection format instead.
  
  Let me go back to Town first and explore more, or try a different approach. Actually, I should check if I can "go Stone Ridge" from here since it's listed as a connection.

LEARNING:
  fartravel only works with known/discovered areas. Undiscovered areas might require different travel methods. Need to test "go" action for connections.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"area-d1-i4"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Stone Ridge (discovered) (33t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Stone Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections at this distance: 33t - Greenhold Verge (partly explored)

=== TICK 133 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent! I successfully traveled to Stone Ridge using "go Stone Ridge". The travel cost 33 ticks (total now 75 ticks used).
  
  Stone Ridge is unexplored, so I need to use the explore action to reveal what resources are available here. Given the name "Stone Ridge," this is very likely a mining location with ore nodes.

LEARNING:
  "go <location_name>" works for traveling to connected areas, even if they're undiscovered. The system internally uses area IDs (area-d1-i4).

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Town (40t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (21 to next level, 16% there)
    RNG: lucky (30% percentile) - took 10t, 10t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Stone Ridge **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 40t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 33t - Greenhold Verge (partly explored)

=== TICK 147 ===

REASONING:
  Interesting - after exploring, Stone Ridge still shows "Unexplored (use explore action to start)" but revealed a new connection:
  - 40t - Town (direct route back)
  
  This suggests I need to explore again to find the actual mining resources. The location still says "Unexplored" so there must be more to discover. Let me continue exploring.

LEARNING:
  Some locations may require multiple explore actions before resources are revealed. The explore action also reveals new connections/exits.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered ore vein (14t)
    +1 Exploration XP (20 to next level, 20% there)
    RNG: lucky (31% percentile) - took 14t, 13t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Stone Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Stone ✓, Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 40t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 33t - Greenhold Verge (partly explored)

=== TICK 147 ===

REASONING:
  Perfect! Now Stone Ridge is "Partly explored" and shows a critical resource:
  - Ore vein with: Stone ✓, Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2 - requires level 2 mining)
  
  This is exactly what I need! I can mine Copper Ore here. The ✓ symbols mean I can mine those materials with my current skill level (Mining L1).
  
  Current situation:
  - Ticks used: 133
  - I have an empty inventory (0/20)
  - I can mine Copper Ore here
  - I need copper ore to eventually get copper bars for contracts
  
  I should start mining Copper Ore. I'll use the "focus" mode to gain more XP and improve my mining skill, since I want to eventually reach L3 for APPRAISE ability.

LEARNING:
  Ore veins can have multiple material types. Materials marked with L2+ require that skill level. Materials with ✓ are available at my current skill level.

ACTION: Mine {"type":"Mine","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"copper_ore"}

RESULT:
  ✗ Not at resource node!

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Stone Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Stone ✓, Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 40t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 33t - Greenhold Verge (partly explored)

=== TICK 147 ===

REASONING:
  The mining action failed with NOT_AT_NODE_LOCATION. This means I need to navigate to the actual node location first. The "Ore vein" is listed as a gathering resource, but I need to "go" to it or use a different command to access it.
  
  Let me try using "go" to navigate to the ore vein location.

LEARNING:
  Resources listed at a location aren't directly accessible - you need to navigate to their specific location first.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Ore vein"}

RESULT:
  ✗ No path to destination!

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Stone Ridge **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Stone ✓, Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 40t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 33t - Greenhold Verge (partly explored)

=== TICK 173 ===

REASONING:
  The "go Ore vein" command failed with NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION. That's not the right syntax for accessing the node.
  
  Let me reconsider - the mine command format is "mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]". Maybe I need to use a different material identifier. Looking back at the error, it said NOT_AT_NODE_LOCATION when I tried "mine focus copper_ore".
  
  Perhaps I need to explore more at Stone Ridge to reveal sub-locations, or the material name format is different. Let me try exploring again to see if it reveals more detail about the node location.

LEARNING:
  Resources require specific node locations that may need to be revealed through exploration.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Timber Edge (15t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (19 to next level, 24% there)
    RNG: lucky (30% percentile) - took 26t, 27t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Stone Ridge **
  
  Fully explored!
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Stone ✓, Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 40t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 15t - Timber Edge (undiscovered), 33t - Greenhold Verge (partly explored)

=== TICK 195 ===

REASONING:
  Great! Stone Ridge is now "Fully explored!" and I discovered a new connection:
  - 15t - Timber Edge (undiscovered)
  
  However, I still need to access the Ore vein to mine. The location shows the resources but I'm not AT the node yet. Let me try using "survey" - this might be a location reconnaissance action that reveals sub-locations or node details without mining.

LEARNING:
  Exploration progresses through stages (Unexplored → Partly explored → Fully explored), revealing new connections at each stage.

ACTION: Survey {"type":"Survey"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered Timber Edge (15t travel time)
    +2 Exploration XP (17 to next level, 32% there)
    RNG: unlucky (77% percentile) - took 22t, 9t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** Stone Ridge **
  
  Fully explored!
  
  Gathering:
    Ore vein - Stone ✓, Copper Ore ✓, Tin Ore (L2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 40t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 15t - Timber Edge (unexplored), 33t - Greenhold Verge (partly explored)
