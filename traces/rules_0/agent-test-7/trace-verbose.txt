--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- The state always shows "Available actions:" listing valid actions for your current situation
- Each action shows its time cost in ticks (t)
- Actions marked "~Nt, varies" have RNG-dependent duration (exploration actions)
- Actions with success probability shown (e.g., "70% success") may fail
- Only attempt actions from this list
- Arguments shown as <placeholder> must be filled with valid values from the state

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm starting a new game with an empty inventory and no skills. I'm in Town Square with access to several guilds and a warehouse. My goal is to have fun while exploring this resource gathering game. 

Since I know nothing about the game world yet, I should start by exploring the available guilds to understand what skills and activities exist. The Miners Guild seems like a logical starting point for a resource gathering game. I'll visit it to see what opportunities are available.

ACTION: go Miners Guild

LEARNING: Starting the game - need to discover what guilds offer and what skills/activities are available.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. However, I don't have any materials or skills yet. 

The logical first step is to enrol in this guild to learn mining skills. This will cost 3 ticks and should unlock the ability to mine materials. Once I can mine, I can gather copper ore and work toward fulfilling contracts.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: Miners Guild offers a contract system. Contract miners-guild-1 exchanges 2 COPPER_BAR for 5 COPPER_ORE (likely a reversal - I probably need to collect ore first, then trade it in). Enroling seems to be how I learn skills.

REASONING: Great! I've successfully enrolled and gained Mining L1 with a FOCUS specialization. I can see that APPRAISE unlocks at L3. The contract still shows - I need 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE. 

However, I notice the contract display seems backwards from what I'd expect. In resource games, typically I gather ORE and refine it into BARS. This contract might mean: I give 5 COPPER_ORE and receive 2 COPPER_BAR, OR it could be showing input→output. Either way, I need to find copper ore deposits to mine.

Before accepting contracts, I should explore to find mining locations. Let me leave and explore other areas or check if there are mining nodes nearby.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm back at Town Square (T3 elapsed). I have Mining L1 but no materials yet. I need to find mining locations. The game mentioned "Connections: none known" - this suggests there are other areas beyond the guilds I see here. 

I should explore systematically. Let me try visiting the Explorers Guild since their purpose might be to help explore new areas, OR I could try the Warehouse to understand the economy. Actually, the most direct approach is to try exploring from here or visiting areas that might have resource nodes.

Let me try the Explorers Guild first - they might have information about where to find resources or help with exploration.

ACTION: go Explorers Guild

LEARNING: Town Square is the hub with no connections to mining areas yet visible. Need to find where copper ore deposits are located.

- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- The state always shows "Available actions:" listing valid actions for your current situation
- Each action shows its time cost in ticks (t)
- Actions marked "~Nt, varies" have RNG-dependent duration (exploration actions)
- Actions with success probability shown (e.g., "70% success") may fail
- Only attempt actions from this list
- Arguments shown as <placeholder> must be filled with valid values from the state

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm starting a new game with an empty inventory and no skills. I'm in Town Square with access to several guilds and a warehouse. My goal is to have fun while exploring this resource gathering game. 

Since I know nothing about the game world yet, I should start by exploring the available guilds to understand what skills and activities exist. The Miners Guild seems like a logical starting point for a resource gathering game. I'll visit it to see what opportunities are available.

ACTION: go Miners Guild

LEARNING: Starting the game - need to discover what guilds offer and what skills/activities are available.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. However, I don't have any materials or skills yet. 

The logical first step is to enrol in this guild to learn mining skills. This will cost 3 ticks and should unlock the ability to mine materials. Once I can mine, I can gather copper ore and work toward fulfilling contracts.

ACTION: enrol

LEARNING: Miners Guild offers a contract system. Contract miners-guild-1 exchanges 2 COPPER_BAR for 5 COPPER_ORE (likely a reversal - I probably need to collect ore first, then trade it in). Enroling seems to be how I learn skills.

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I've successfully enrolled and gained Mining L1 with a FOCUS specialization. I can see that APPRAISE unlocks at L3. The contract still shows - I need 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE. 

However, I notice the contract display seems backwards from what I'd expect. In resource games, typically I gather ORE and refine it into BARS. This contract might mean: I give 5 COPPER_ORE and receive 2 COPPER_BAR, OR it could be showing input→output. Either way, I need to find copper ore deposits to mine.

Before accepting contracts, I should explore to find mining locations. Let me leave and explore other areas or check if there are mining nodes nearby.

ACTION: leave

LEARNING: 
- Enroling takes 3 ticks and grants a skill (Mining L1)
- Skills have specializations (FOCUS in this case)
- Skills have unlock conditions (APPRAISE unlocks at L3)

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm back at Town Square (T3 elapsed). I have Mining L1 but no materials yet. I need to find mining locations. The game mentioned "Connections: none known" - this suggests there are other areas beyond the guilds I see here. 

I should explore systematically. Let me try visiting the Explorers Guild since their purpose might be to help explore new areas, OR I could try the Warehouse to understand the economy. Actually, the most direct approach is to try exploring from here or visiting areas that might have resource nodes.

Let me try the Explorers Guild first - they might have information about where to find resources or help with exploration.

ACTION: go Explorers Guild

LEARNING: Town Square is the hub with no connections to mining areas yet visible. Need to find where copper ore deposits are located.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- The state always shows "Available actions:" listing valid actions for your current situation
- Each action shows its time cost in ticks (t)
- Actions marked "~Nt, varies" have RNG-dependent duration (exploration actions)
- Actions with success probability shown (e.g., "70% success") may fail
- Only attempt actions from this list
- Arguments shown as <placeholder> must be filled with valid values from the state

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

Available actions:
  - leave (0t)
  - accept <contract> (0t)

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I've successfully enrolled and gained Mining L1 with a FOCUS specialization. I can see that APPRAISE unlocks at L3. The contract still shows - I need 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE. 

However, I notice the contract display seems backwards from what I'd expect. In resource games, typically I gather ORE and refine it into BARS. This contract might mean: I give 5 COPPER_ORE and receive 2 COPPER_BAR, OR it could be showing input→output. Either way, I need to find copper ore deposits to mine.

Before accepting contracts, I should explore to find mining locations. Let me leave and explore other areas or check if there are mining nodes nearby.

ACTION: leave

LEARNING: 
- Enroling takes 3 ticks and grants a skill (Mining L1)
- Skills have specializations (FOCUS in this case)
- Skills have unlock conditions (APPRAISE unlocks at L3)
- Contract format might be confusing - need to see actual execution

- Travel further to The Green Margins (18t via fartravel) to map more of the world

Since I'm trying to find copper ore for mining, I should fully explore this area first before moving on. The decreased explore time (27t) suggests the survey made it easier. Let me explore fully.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Survey action partially reveals areas and reduces subsequent survey/explore costs. Surveys grant Exploration XP. Multiple areas exist beyond Town Square - the world is larger than initially visible.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- The state always shows "Available actions:" listing valid actions for your current situation
- Each action shows its time cost in ticks (t)
- Actions marked "~Nt, varies" have RNG-dependent duration (exploration actions)
- Actions with success probability shown (e.g., "70% success") may fail
- Only attempt actions from this list
- Arguments shown as <placeholder> must be filled with valid values from the state

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm at the Explorers Guild. I can enrol here for 3 ticks. The Explorers Guild might teach exploration skills that help me find new areas and resources. This could be valuable for discovering mining locations.

Let me enrol to learn what exploration offers - it might unlock the ability to explore new areas or discover resource nodes.

ACTION: enrol

  - go <area> (varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! Now I can see a connection: "The Whispering Copse (unexplored)" is 6 ticks away. This is likely a new area with resources. The action format shows "fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)" which suggests it takes about 6 ticks with some variation.

Given my exploration skill, I should travel there to discover what resources are available. This could be where mining locations are, or at least help me map out the world. With 6 ticks to reach it and variable time, I have room in my session budget.

Let me fartravel to The Whispering Copse.

ACTION: fartravel The Whispering Copse

LEARNING: Exploration skill unlocks visibility of new areas. "Connections further from Town" suggests a wider world exists beyond the immediate guilds. Travel times can vary (~6t suggests RNG element).

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~20t, varies)
  - explore (~40t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: I've arrived at The Whispering Copse (T12 elapsed). It's marked "Unexplored" and I have two exploration options:
- survey (~20t, varies) - faster, likely gives overview
- explore (~40t, varies) - slower, likely more thorough/detailed

Survey seems like the smarter first move - it will take 20 ticks to get information about what's in this area (resources, connections, etc.) without committing to a full 40-tick exploration. Once I know what's here, I can decide if it's worth the full exploration or if I should move on.

Let me survey first.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: New areas are "Unexplored" and require survey or explore actions to reveal contents. Survey is faster than explore (~20t vs ~40t).

  - survey (~13t, varies)
  - explore (~27t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~18t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey revealed useful information! I gained +2 Exploration XP and now see:
1. The Whispering Copse is still "Unexplored" - survey didn't fully reveal it
2. A NEW CONNECTION: The Green Margins (unexplored, 29t away)
3. Survey and explore times have DECREASED (~13t and ~27t) - surveys appear to reduce subsequent action costs

The area is still unexplored. I have two strategic options:
- Continue exploring here (27t) to find resources
- Travel further to The Green Margins (18t via fartravel) to map more of the world

Since I'm trying to find copper ore for mining, I should fully explore this area first before moving on. The decreased explore time (27t) suggests the survey made it easier. Let me explore fully.

  - explore (~53t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~18t, varies)

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Exploration revealed an enemy camp (difficulty 2) in The Whispering Copse. The area is "Partly explored" - there's more to discover. However, I notice:
1. No resource nodes visible yet (no copper ore, no trees)
2. An enemy camp suggests combat potential but I haven't enrolled in Combat Guild
3. Further explore would cost 53t (significantly more) to continue here

Strategy: I should move on to The Green Margins to continue mapping and find actual resource nodes. Enemy camps might be for later when I have combat skills. The Green Margins is 29t away - let me fartravel there (18t shows it's closer via fartravel than the direct connection).

ACTION: fartravel The Green Margins

LEARNING: Areas can be "Partly explored" with additional exploration revealing more. Enemy camps exist in areas. Exploration XP is gained incrementally from explore actions.

Available actions:
  - go <location> (0t)
  - go <area> (varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Excellent! Now I can see a connection: "The Whispering Copse (unexplored)" is 6 ticks away. This is likely a new area with resources. The action format shows "fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)" which suggests it takes about 6 ticks with some variation.

Given my exploration skill, I should travel there to discover what resources are available. This could be where mining locations are, or at least help me map out the world. With 6 ticks to reach it and variable time, I have room in my session budget.

Let me fartravel to The Whispering Copse.

ACTION: fartravel The Whispering Copse

LEARNING: Exploration skill unlocks visibility of new areas. "Connections further from Town" suggests a wider world exists beyond the immediate guilds. Travel times can vary (~6t suggests RNG element).

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~20t, varies)
  - explore (~40t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: I've arrived at The Whispering Copse (T12 elapsed). It's marked "Unexplored" and I have two exploration options:
- survey (~20t, varies) - faster, likely gives overview
- explore (~40t, varies) - slower, likely more thorough/detailed

Survey seems like the smarter first move - it will take 20 ticks to get information about what's in this area (resources, connections, etc.) without committing to a full 40-tick exploration. Once I know what's here, I can decide if it's worth the full exploration or if I should move on.

Let me survey first.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: New areas are "Unexplored" and require survey or explore actions to reveal contents. Survey is faster than explore (~20t vs ~40t).

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~13t, varies)
  - explore (~27t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~18t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey revealed useful information! I gained +2 Exploration XP and now see:
1. The Whispering Copse is still "Unexplored" - survey didn't fully reveal it
2. A NEW CONNECTION: The Green Margins (unexplored, 29t away)
3. Survey and explore times have DECREASED (~13t and ~27t) - surveys appear to reduce subsequent action costs

The area is still unexplored. I have two strategic options:
- Continue exploring here (27t) to find resources
- Travel further to The Green Margins (18t via fartravel) to map more of the world

Since I'm trying to find copper ore for mining, I should fully explore this area first before moving on. The decreased explore time (27t) suggests the survey made it easier. Let me explore fully.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Survey action partially reveals areas and reduces subsequent survey/explore costs. Surveys grant Exploration XP. Multiple areas exist beyond Town Square - the world is larger than initially visible.

  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~13t, varies)
  - explore (~53t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~18t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Exploration revealed an enemy camp (difficulty 2) in The Whispering Copse. The area is "Partly explored" - there's more to discover. However, I notice:
1. No resource nodes visible yet (no copper ore, no trees)
2. An enemy camp suggests combat potential but I haven't enrolled in Combat Guild
3. Further explore would cost 53t (significantly more) to continue here

Strategy: I should move on to The Green Margins to continue mapping and find actual resource nodes. Enemy camps might be for later when I have combat skills. The Green Margins is 29t away - let me fartravel there (18t shows it's closer via fartravel than the direct connection).

ACTION: fartravel The Green Margins

LEARNING: Areas can be "Partly explored" with additional exploration revealing more. Enemy camps exist in areas. Exploration XP is gained incrementally from explore actions.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at The Green Margins (T103 elapsed). It's unexplored and I have survey/explore options both at ~20t. Since this is a new area and I want to find resources:
- Survey first (~20t) to get an overview and see what's here
- Then decide if full exploration is needed

I'm looking for copper ore nodes or other minable resources. Survey should reveal what's available.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: FarTravel took 29t (matches the connection time). I'm making good progress mapping the world. Session still has budget (T103/likely much larger limit).

Partly explored

Connections at this distance: 29t - The Whispering Copse (partly explored)

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~13t, varies)
  - explore (~13t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~33t, varies)

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Survey revealed more of the world:
1. The Green Margins is now "Partly explored"
2. A NEW AREA: The Veined Reach (unexplored, 35t away) - "Veined" suggests ore deposits!
3. Survey/explore costs dropped to ~13t (faster than before)
4. I gained +2 Exploration XP (now at L1 with 5 XP total)

This is excellent progress. The name "The Veined Reach" strongly suggests mineral/ore resources. However, I'm still not seeing actual resource nodes displayed here at Green Margins. Let me continue exploring this area first (13t) to see if there are resources here, then decide whether to push to The Veined Reach.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Survey reveals additional connections. Area names suggest content (e.g., "Veined" = ore). Exploration XP accumulates toward level-ups. Survey/explore times improve as areas become "partly explored."

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Exploration complete at The Green Margins. Current observations:
1. Still "Partly explored" - more to discover but explore cost jumped to 40t
2. Still NO RESOURCE NODES visible here (no copper, no wood)
3. The Veined Reach (35t away) is my target - the name suggests ore deposits
4. I can reach it via direct connection (35t) or fartravel (~26t)

Decision: Move to The Veined Reach now. It's the most promising location for copper ore based on its name. I'll use fartravel (26t) since it's faster than the direct connection (35t).

ACTION: fartravel The Veined Reach

LEARNING: "Partly explored" areas may have multiple levels of exploration. Resource nodes only appear when fully explored or in certain areas. The Veined Reach naming convention suggests mineral content.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- The state always shows "Available actions:" listing valid actions for your current situation
- Each action shows its time cost in ticks (t)
- Actions marked "~Nt, varies" have RNG-dependent duration (exploration actions)
- Actions with success probability shown (e.g., "70% success") may fail
- Only attempt actions from this list
- Arguments shown as <placeholder> must be filled with valid values from the state

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

** The Whispering Copse **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~13t, varies)
  - explore (~27t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~18t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey revealed useful information! I gained +2 Exploration XP and now see:
1. The Whispering Copse is still "Unexplored" - survey didn't fully reveal it
2. A NEW CONNECTION: The Green Margins (unexplored, 29t away)
3. Survey and explore times have DECREASED (~13t and ~27t) - surveys appear to reduce subsequent action costs

The area is still unexplored. I have two strategic options:
- Continue exploring here (27t) to find resources
- Travel further to The Green Margins (18t via fartravel) to map more of the world

Since I'm trying to find copper ore for mining, I should fully explore this area first before moving on. The decreased explore time (27t) suggests the survey made it easier. Let me explore fully.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Survey action partially reveals areas and reduces subsequent survey/explore costs. Surveys grant Exploration XP. Multiple areas exist beyond Town Square - the world is larger than initially visible.

  - fartravel <area> (~18t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Exploration revealed an enemy camp (difficulty 2) in The Whispering Copse. The area is "Partly explored" - there's more to discover. However, I notice:
1. No resource nodes visible yet (no copper ore, no trees)
2. An enemy camp suggests combat potential but I haven't enrolled in Combat Guild
3. Further explore would cost 53t (significantly more) to continue here

Strategy: I should move on to The Green Margins to continue mapping and find actual resource nodes. Enemy camps might be for later when I have combat skills. The Green Margins is 29t away - let me fartravel there (18t shows it's closer via fartravel than the direct connection).

ACTION: fartravel The Green Margins

LEARNING: Areas can be "Partly explored" with additional exploration revealing more. Enemy camps exist in areas. Exploration XP is gained incrementally from explore actions.

- Survey first (~20t) to get an overview and see what's here
- Then decide if full exploration is needed

I'm looking for copper ore nodes or other minable resources. Survey should reveal what's available.

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey revealed more of the world:

2. A NEW AREA: The Veined Reach (unexplored, 35t away) - "Veined" suggests ore deposits!
3. Survey/explore costs dropped to ~13t (faster than before)
4. I gained +2 Exploration XP (now at L1 with 5 XP total)

This is excellent progress. The name "The Veined Reach" strongly suggests mineral/ore resources. However, I'm still not seeing actual resource nodes displayed here at Green Margins. Let me continue exploring this area first (13t) to see if there are resources here, then decide whether to push to The Veined Reach.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Survey reveals additional connections. Area names suggest content (e.g., "Veined" = ore). Exploration XP accumulates toward level-ups. Survey/explore times improve as areas become "partly explored."

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm now at The Veined Reach (T260 elapsed). It's completely unexplored with high action costs (~40t survey, ~80t explore). This is a remote area - the highest costs yet.

Strategy decision:
1. Survey first (~40t) to reveal what's here without full exploration
2. If resources are visible, I can start mining
3. Full exploration (80t) can wait until I understand what's available

The "Veined" name strongly suggests ore deposits. Let me survey to confirm.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: FarTravel to The Veined Reach took 35t (not 26t as estimated). Remote areas have higher base costs. I'm deep in exploration now - T260/session.

[assistant]: REASONING: Exploration complete at The Green Margins. Current observations:
1. Still "Partly explored" - more to discover but explore cost jumped to 40t
2. Still NO RESOURCE NODES visible here (no copper, no wood)
3. The Veined Reach (35t away) is my target - the name suggests ore deposits
4. I can reach it via direct connection (35t) or fartravel (~26t)

Decision: Move to The Veined Reach now. It's the most promising location for copper ore based on its name. I'll use fartravel (26t) since it's faster than the direct connection (35t).

ACTION: fartravel The Veined Reach

LEARNING: "Partly explored" areas may have multiple levels of exploration. Resource nodes only appear when fully explored or in certain areas. The Veined Reach naming convention suggests mineral content.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at The Veined Reach (T260 elapsed). It's completely unexplored with high action costs (~40t survey, ~80t explore). This is a remote area - the highest costs yet.

Strategy decision:
1. Survey first (~40t) to reveal what's here without full exploration
2. If resources are visible, I can start mining
3. Full exploration (80t) can wait until I understand what's available

The "Veined" name strongly suggests ore deposits. Let me survey to confirm.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: FarTravel to The Veined Reach took 35t (not 26t as estimated). Remote areas have higher base costs. I'm deep in exploration now - T260/session.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Survey revealed:
1. The Veined Reach is now "Partly explored" (+2 XP, now at L1 with 8 XP)
2. A NEW AREA discovered: The Settlers' Edge (unexplored, 30t closer to Town)
3. Still NO RESOURCE NODES visible here despite the "Veined" name
4. Action costs dropped to ~20t survey, ~40t explore

This is problematic - no visible ore nodes yet. Options:
1. Continue exploring The Veined Reach (40t) to find resources
2. Check The Settlers' Edge (30t away) - maybe resources are there
3. Return to an earlier area and fully explore

However, I notice I haven't actually SEEN any resource nodes anywhere yet. Let me continue exploring here (40t) since I'm already invested in this remote area. The Veined Reach should have ore given its name.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: New areas continue to appear from survey. Resource visibility may require full exploration of an area. The Settlers' Edge is now on the map - potentially closer to Town than previous explorations.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- The state always shows "Available actions:" listing valid actions for your current situation
- Each action shows its time cost in ticks (t)
- Actions marked "~Nt, varies" have RNG-dependent duration (exploration actions)
- Actions with success probability shown (e.g., "70% success") may fail
- Only attempt actions from this list
- Arguments shown as <placeholder> must be filled with valid values from the state

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- go <area name>
- go <location in current area>
- fartravel <far away area name>
- leave
- explore
- survey
- enrol
- accept <contract_id>
- mine <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- chop <focus | careful_all | appraise> [material_id]
- fight
- craft <recipe_id>
- store <quantity> <item_id>
- drop <quantity> <item_id>


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

EXAMPLE OF GOOD NOTES FORMAT:
"Areas visited: [list]. Travel times: [A→B: Xt].
Skills: [name] L[n] ([x]/[y] XP). Current plan: [goal]."

EXAMPLE OF GOOD REASONING:
"I see [observation]. My notes say [relevant fact].
I should [action] because [reason]. If it fails, I'll try [backup]."

NOTE-TAKING STRATEGY:
- Use consistent shorthand (L2 = level 2, t = ticks)
- Group related facts (all travel times together)
- Update incrementally - don't rewrite everything each turn
- Prioritize: contracts > resources > travel > misc

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at The Green Margins (T103 elapsed). It's unexplored and I have survey/explore options both at ~20t. Since this is a new area and I want to find resources:
- Survey first (~20t) to get an overview and see what's here
- Then decide if full exploration is needed

I'm looking for copper ore nodes or other minable resources. Survey should reveal what's available.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: FarTravel took 29t (matches the connection time). I'm making good progress mapping the world. Session still has budget (T103/likely much larger limit).

This is excellent progress. The name "The Veined Reach" strongly suggests mineral/ore resources. However, I'm still not seeing actual resource nodes displayed here at Green Margins. Let me continue exploring this area first (13t) to see if there are resources here, then decide whether to push to The Veined Reach.

2. Still at "Partly explored" - more to discover here
3. Gained +1 XP (now L1 with 9 XP)
4. Still NO VISIBLE RESOURCE NODES

This is concerning. I've explored 3 areas (Copse, Green Margins, Veined Reach) and haven't seen a single resource node yet. Possibilities:
- Resources only appear in fully explored areas (not "partly explored")
- Resources are in specific locations I haven't found yet
- I need to be at a deeper exploration level

Decision: Check The Silent Verge (16t away). It's much closer and undiscovered - maybe it has visible resources. If not, I'll reconsider my strategy (possibly return to Town Square and try a different direction).

ACTION: fartravel The Silent Verge

LEARNING: "Undiscovered" areas can appear from exploration actions. The Silent Verge is very close (16t) - suggests a dense area network. Still haven't found any resource nodes despite significant exploration.

** The Green Margins **

Partly explored

Connections closer to Town: 13t - Town
Connections at this distance: 29t - The Whispering Copse (partly explored)
Connections further from Town: 35t - The Veined Reach (unexplored)

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~10t, varies)
  - explore (~40t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~26t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Exploration complete at The Green Margins. Current observations:
1. Still "Partly explored" - more to discover but explore cost jumped to 40t
2. Still NO RESOURCE NODES visible here (no copper, no wood)
3. The Veined Reach (35t away) is my target - the name suggests ore deposits
4. I can reach it via direct connection (35t) or fartravel (~26t)

Decision: Move to The Veined Reach now. It's the most promising location for copper ore based on its name. I'll use fartravel (26t) since it's faster than the direct connection (35t).

ACTION: fartravel The Veined Reach

LEARNING: "Partly explored" areas may have multiple levels of exploration. Resource nodes only appear when fully explored or in certain areas. The Veined Reach naming convention suggests mineral content.

** The Veined Reach **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 35t - The Green Margins (partly explored)

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~40t, varies)
  - explore (~80t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~49t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at The Veined Reach (T260 elapsed). It's completely unexplored with high action costs (~40t survey, ~80t explore). This is a remote area - the highest costs yet.

Strategy decision:
1. Survey first (~40t) to reveal what's here without full exploration
2. If resources are visible, I can start mining
3. Full exploration (80t) can wait until I understand what's available

The "Veined" name strongly suggests ore deposits. Let me survey to confirm.

ACTION: survey

LEARNING: FarTravel to The Veined Reach took 35t (not 26t as estimated). Remote areas have higher base costs. I'm deep in exploration now - T260/session.

** The Veined Reach **

Partly explored

Connections closer to Town: 30t - The Settlers' Edge (unexplored), 35t - The Green Margins (partly explored)

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~20t, varies)
  - explore (~40t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~44t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Survey revealed:
1. The Veined Reach is now "Partly explored" (+2 XP, now at L1 with 8 XP)
2. A NEW AREA discovered: The Settlers' Edge (unexplored, 30t closer to Town)
3. Still NO RESOURCE NODES visible here despite the "Veined" name
4. Action costs dropped to ~20t survey, ~40t explore

This is problematic - no visible ore nodes yet. Options:
1. Continue exploring The Veined Reach (40t) to find resources
2. Check The Settlers' Edge (30t away) - maybe resources are there
3. Return to an earlier area and fully explore

However, I notice I haven't actually SEEN any resource nodes anywhere yet. Let me continue exploring here (40t) since I'm already invested in this remote area. The Veined Reach should have ore given its name.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: New areas continue to appear from survey. Resource visibility may require full exploration of an area. The Settlers' Edge is now on the map - potentially closer to Town than previous explorations.

** The Veined Reach **

Partly explored

Connections closer to Town: 30t - The Settlers' Edge (unexplored), 35t - The Green Margins (partly explored)
Connections at this distance: 16t - The Silent Verge (undiscovered)

Available actions:
  - go <area> (varies)
  - survey (~20t, varies)
  - explore (~40t, varies)
  - fartravel <area> (~44t, varies)

[assistant]: REASONING: Exploration revealed:
1. Another NEW AREA: The Silent Verge (undiscovered, only 16t away!) - closest unexplored area yet
2. Still at "Partly explored" - more to discover here
3. Gained +1 XP (now L1 with 9 XP)
4. Still NO VISIBLE RESOURCE NODES

This is concerning. I've explored 3 areas (Copse, Green Margins, Veined Reach) and haven't seen a single resource node yet. Possibilities:
- Resources only appear in fully explored areas (not "partly explored")
- Resources are in specific locations I haven't found yet
- I need to be at a deeper exploration level

Decision: Check The Silent Verge (16t away). It's much closer and undiscovered - maybe it has visible resources. If not, I'll reconsider my strategy (possibly return to Town Square and try a different direction).

ACTION: fartravel The Silent Verge

LEARNING: "Undiscovered" areas can appear from exploration actions. The Silent Verge is very close (16t) - suggests a dense area network. Still haven't found any resource nodes despite significant exploration.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: FarTravel failed with NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION. Important learning:
- "Undiscovered" areas cannot be reached via fartravel
- I need to use the direct connection (16t) via "go" instead
- FarTravel only works for known/discovered areas

The Silent Verge is listed as a connection at 16t distance. I should use "go The Silent Verge" instead.

ACTION: go The Silent Verge

LEARNING: FarTravel cannot reach "undiscovered" areas - must use direct connections. Undiscovered areas are still accessible via "go" action through discovered connections.
