TRACE LOG
================================================================================

=== TICK 0 ===

REASONING:
  I'm starting a new game with an empty inventory and no skills. I'm in Town Square with access to several guilds and a warehouse. My goal is to have fun while exploring this resource gathering game. 
  
  Since I know nothing about the game world yet, I should start by exploring the available guilds to understand what skills and activities exist. The Miners Guild seems like a logical starting point for a resource gathering game. I'll visit it to see what opportunities are available.

LEARNING:
  Starting the game - need to discover what guilds offer and what skills/activities are available.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Miners Guild"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Miners Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: none
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  
  Available actions:
    - leave (0t)
    - enrol (3t)
    - accept <contract> (0t)

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  I'm now at the Miners Guild. I can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE and +10 reputation. However, I don't have any materials or skills yet. 
  
  The logical first step is to enrol in this guild to learn mining skills. This will cost 3 ticks and should unlock the ability to mine materials. Once I can mine, I can gather copper ore and work toward fulfilling contracts.

LEARNING:
  Miners Guild offers a contract system. Contract miners-guild-1 exchanges 2 COPPER_BAR for 5 COPPER_ORE (likely a reversal - I probably need to collect ore first, then trade it in). Enroling seems to be how I learn skills.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Mining guild (3t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  
  Available actions:
    - leave (0t)
    - accept <contract> (0t)

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  Great! I've successfully enrolled and gained Mining L1 with a FOCUS specialization. I can see that APPRAISE unlocks at L3. The contract still shows - I need 2 COPPER_BAR to get 5 COPPER_ORE. 
  
  However, I notice the contract display seems backwards from what I'd expect. In resource games, typically I gather ORE and refine it into BARS. This contract might mean: I give 5 COPPER_ORE and receive 2 COPPER_BAR, OR it could be showing input→output. Either way, I need to find copper ore deposits to mine.
  
  Before accepting contracts, I should explore to find mining locations. Let me leave and explore other areas or check if there are mining nodes nearby.

LEARNING:
  - Enroling takes 3 ticks and grants a skill (Mining L1)
  - Skills have specializations (FOCUS in this case)
  - Skills have unlock conditions (APPRAISE unlocks at L3)
  - Contract format might be confusing - need to see actual execution

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Miners Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go <name>): Warehouse
  Connections: none known
  
  Available actions:
    - go <location> (0t)

=== TICK 3 ===

REASONING:
  I'm back at Town Square (T3 elapsed). I have Mining L1 but no materials yet. I need to find mining locations. The game mentioned "Connections: none known" - this suggests there are other areas beyond the guilds I see here. 
  
  I should explore systematically. Let me try visiting the Explorers Guild since their purpose might be to help explore new areas, OR I could try the Warehouse to understand the economy. Actually, the most direct approach is to try exploring from here or visiting areas that might have resource nodes.
  
  Let me try the Explorers Guild first - they might have information about where to find resources or help with exploration.

LEARNING:
  Town Square is the hub with no connections to mining areas yet visible. Need to find where copper ore deposits are located.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"Explorers Guild"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Explorers Guild

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  
  Available actions:
    - leave (0t)
    - enrol (3t)

=== TICK 6 ===

REASONING:
  I'm at the Explorers Guild. I can enrol here for 3 ticks. The Explorers Guild might teach exploration skills that help me find new areas and resources. This could be valuable for discovering mining locations.
  
  Let me enrol to learn what exploration offers - it might unlock the ability to explore new areas or discover resource nodes.

LEARNING:
  Explorers Guild exists and allows enrolment, similar to Miners Guild structure.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Exploration guild, discovered The Whispering Copse (6t travel time)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  
  Available actions:
    - leave (0t)

=== TICK 6 ===

REASONING:
  Good! I've enrolled in Exploration L1 (T6 elapsed). Now I have two skills. With exploration, I should be able to discover new areas. Let me leave and try exploring - this might reveal mining locations or other resource areas.

LEARNING:
  Exploration L1 is now available - should enable exploration actions.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Explorers Guild for Town Square

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 6t - The Whispering Copse (unexplored)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <location> (0t)
    - go <area> (varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)

=== TICK 12 ===

REASONING:
  Excellent! Now I can see a connection: "The Whispering Copse (unexplored)" is 6 ticks away. This is likely a new area with resources. The action format shows "fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)" which suggests it takes about 6 ticks with some variation.
  
  Given my exploration skill, I should travel there to discover what resources are available. This could be where mining locations are, or at least help me map out the world. With 6 ticks to reach it and variable time, I have room in my session budget.
  
  Let me fartravel to The Whispering Copse.

LEARNING:
  Exploration skill unlocks visibility of new areas. "Connections further from Town" suggests a wider world exists beyond the immediate guilds. Travel times can vary (~6t suggests RNG element).

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"The Whispering Copse"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Far traveled to The Whispering Copse (1 hop) (6t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Whispering Copse **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 6t - Town
  
  Available actions:
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~20t, varies)
    - explore (~40t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~6t, varies)

=== TICK 18 ===

REASONING:
  I've arrived at The Whispering Copse (T12 elapsed). It's marked "Unexplored" and I have two exploration options:
  - survey (~20t, varies) - faster, likely gives overview
  - explore (~40t, varies) - slower, likely more thorough/detailed
  
  Survey seems like the smarter first move - it will take 20 ticks to get information about what's in this area (resources, connections, etc.) without committing to a full 40-tick exploration. Once I know what's here, I can decide if it's worth the full exploration or if I should move on.
  
  Let me survey first.

LEARNING:
  New areas are "Unexplored" and require survey or explore actions to reveal contents. Survey is faster than explore (~20t vs ~40t).

ACTION: Survey {"type":"Survey"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered The Green Margins (29t travel time)
    +2 Exploration XP (23 to next level, 8% there)
    RNG: lucky (23% percentile) - took 6t, 14t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Whispering Copse **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 6t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 29t - The Green Margins (unexplored)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~13t, varies)
    - explore (~27t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~18t, varies)

=== TICK 74 ===

REASONING:
  Survey revealed useful information! I gained +2 Exploration XP and now see:
  1. The Whispering Copse is still "Unexplored" - survey didn't fully reveal it
  2. A NEW CONNECTION: The Green Margins (unexplored, 29t away)
  3. Survey and explore times have DECREASED (~13t and ~27t) - surveys appear to reduce subsequent action costs
  
  The area is still unexplored. I have two strategic options:
  - Continue exploring here (27t) to find resources
  - Travel further to The Green Margins (18t via fartravel) to map more of the world
  
  Since I'm trying to find copper ore for mining, I should fully explore this area first before moving on. The decreased explore time (27t) suggests the survey made it easier. Let me explore fully.

LEARNING:
  Survey action partially reveals areas and reduces subsequent survey/explore costs. Surveys grant Exploration XP. Multiple areas exist beyond Town Square - the world is larger than initially visible.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered enemy camp (56t)
    +1 Exploration XP (22 to next level, 12% there)
    RNG: very unlucky (87% percentile) - took 56t, 29t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Whispering Copse **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Enemy camps: enemy camp (difficulty 2)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 6t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 29t - The Green Margins (unexplored)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <location> (1t)
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~13t, varies)
    - explore (~53t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~18t, varies)

=== TICK 103 ===

REASONING:
  Exploration revealed an enemy camp (difficulty 2) in The Whispering Copse. The area is "Partly explored" - there's more to discover. However, I notice:
  1. No resource nodes visible yet (no copper ore, no trees)
  2. An enemy camp suggests combat potential but I haven't enrolled in Combat Guild
  3. Further explore would cost 53t (significantly more) to continue here
  
  Strategy: I should move on to The Green Margins to continue mapping and find actual resource nodes. Enemy camps might be for later when I have combat skills. The Green Margins is 29t away - let me fartravel there (18t shows it's closer via fartravel than the direct connection).

LEARNING:
  Areas can be "Partly explored" with additional exploration revealing more. Enemy camps exist in areas. Exploration XP is gained incrementally from explore actions.

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"The Green Margins"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Far traveled to The Green Margins (1 hop) (29t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Green Margins **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections at this distance: 29t - The Whispering Copse (partly explored)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~20t, varies)
    - explore (~20t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~32t, varies)

=== TICK 211 ===

REASONING:
  I'm now at The Green Margins (T103 elapsed). It's unexplored and I have survey/explore options both at ~20t. Since this is a new area and I want to find resources:
  - Survey first (~20t) to get an overview and see what's here
  - Then decide if full exploration is needed
  
  I'm looking for copper ore nodes or other minable resources. Survey should reveal what's available.

LEARNING:
  FarTravel took 29t (matches the connection time). I'm making good progress mapping the world. Session still has budget (T103/likely much larger limit).

ACTION: Survey {"type":"Survey"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered The Veined Reach (35t travel time)
    +2 Exploration XP (20 to next level, 20% there)
    RNG: very unlucky (100% percentile) - took 108t, 88t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Green Margins **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Connections at this distance: 29t - The Whispering Copse (partly explored)
  Connections further from Town: 35t - The Veined Reach (unexplored)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~13t, varies)
    - explore (~13t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~33t, varies)

=== TICK 225 ===

REASONING:
  Survey revealed more of the world:
  1. The Green Margins is now "Partly explored"
  2. A NEW AREA: The Veined Reach (unexplored, 35t away) - "Veined" suggests ore deposits!
  3. Survey/explore costs dropped to ~13t (faster than before)
  4. I gained +2 Exploration XP (now at L1 with 5 XP total)
  
  This is excellent progress. The name "The Veined Reach" strongly suggests mineral/ore resources. However, I'm still not seeing actual resource nodes displayed here at Green Margins. Let me continue exploring this area first (13t) to see if there are resources here, then decide whether to push to The Veined Reach.

LEARNING:
  Survey reveals additional connections. Area names suggest content (e.g., "Veined" = ore). Exploration XP accumulates toward level-ups. Survey/explore times improve as areas become "partly explored."

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to Town (13t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (19 to next level, 24% there)
    RNG: average (53% percentile) - took 14t, 1t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Green Margins **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Connections closer to Town: 13t - Town
  Connections at this distance: 29t - The Whispering Copse (partly explored)
  Connections further from Town: 35t - The Veined Reach (unexplored)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~10t, varies)
    - explore (~40t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~26t, varies)

=== TICK 260 ===

REASONING:
  Exploration complete at The Green Margins. Current observations:
  1. Still "Partly explored" - more to discover but explore cost jumped to 40t
  2. Still NO RESOURCE NODES visible here (no copper, no wood)
  3. The Veined Reach (35t away) is my target - the name suggests ore deposits
  4. I can reach it via direct connection (35t) or fartravel (~26t)
  
  Decision: Move to The Veined Reach now. It's the most promising location for copper ore based on its name. I'll use fartravel (26t) since it's faster than the direct connection (35t).

LEARNING:
  "Partly explored" areas may have multiple levels of exploration. Resource nodes only appear when fully explored or in certain areas. The Veined Reach naming convention suggests mineral content.

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"The Veined Reach"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Far traveled to The Veined Reach (1 hop) (35t)

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Veined Reach **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 35t - The Green Margins (partly explored)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~40t, varies)
    - explore (~80t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~49t, varies)

=== TICK 324 ===

REASONING:
  I'm now at The Veined Reach (T260 elapsed). It's completely unexplored with high action costs (~40t survey, ~80t explore). This is a remote area - the highest costs yet.
  
  Strategy decision:
  1. Survey first (~40t) to reveal what's here without full exploration
  2. If resources are visible, I can start mining
  3. Full exploration (80t) can wait until I understand what's available
  
  The "Veined" name strongly suggests ore deposits. Let me survey to confirm.

LEARNING:
  FarTravel to The Veined Reach took 35t (not 26t as estimated). Remote areas have higher base costs. I'm deep in exploration now - T260/session.

ACTION: Survey {"type":"Survey"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered The Settlers' Edge (30t travel time)
    +2 Exploration XP (17 to next level, 32% there)
    RNG: unlucky (73% percentile) - took 64t, 24t slower than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Veined Reach **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Connections closer to Town: 30t - The Settlers' Edge (unexplored), 35t - The Green Margins (partly explored)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~20t, varies)
    - explore (~40t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~44t, varies)

=== TICK 384 ===

REASONING:
  Survey revealed:
  1. The Veined Reach is now "Partly explored" (+2 XP, now at L1 with 8 XP)
  2. A NEW AREA discovered: The Settlers' Edge (unexplored, 30t closer to Town)
  3. Still NO RESOURCE NODES visible here despite the "Veined" name
  4. Action costs dropped to ~20t survey, ~40t explore
  
  This is problematic - no visible ore nodes yet. Options:
  1. Continue exploring The Veined Reach (40t) to find resources
  2. Check The Settlers' Edge (30t away) - maybe resources are there
  3. Return to an earlier area and fully explore
  
  However, I notice I haven't actually SEEN any resource nodes anywhere yet. Let me continue exploring here (40t) since I'm already invested in this remote area. The Veined Reach should have ore given its name.

LEARNING:
  New areas continue to appear from survey. Resource visibility may require full exploration of an area. The Settlers' Edge is now on the map - potentially closer to Town than previous explorations.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to The Silent Verge (16t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (16 to next level, 36% there)
    RNG: average (40% percentile) - took 60t, 20t faster than expected

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Veined Reach **
  
  Partly explored
  
  Connections closer to Town: 30t - The Settlers' Edge (unexplored), 35t - The Green Margins (partly explored)
  Connections at this distance: 16t - The Silent Verge (undiscovered)
  
  Available actions:
    - go <area> (varies)
    - survey (~20t, varies)
    - explore (~40t, varies)
    - fartravel <area> (~44t, varies)

=== TICK 384 ===

REASONING:
  Exploration revealed:
  1. Another NEW AREA: The Silent Verge (undiscovered, only 16t away!) - closest unexplored area yet
  2. Still at "Partly explored" - more to discover here
  3. Gained +1 XP (now L1 with 9 XP)
  4. Still NO VISIBLE RESOURCE NODES
  
  This is concerning. I've explored 3 areas (Copse, Green Margins, Veined Reach) and haven't seen a single resource node yet. Possibilities:
  - Resources only appear in fully explored areas (not "partly explored")
  - Resources are in specific locations I haven't found yet
  - I need to be at a deeper exploration level
  
  Decision: Check The Silent Verge (16t away). It's much closer and undiscovered - maybe it has visible resources. If not, I'll reconsider my strategy (possibly return to Town Square and try a different direction).

LEARNING:
  "Undiscovered" areas can appear from exploration actions. The Silent Verge is very close (16t) - suggests a dense area network. Still haven't found any resource nodes despite significant exploration.

ACTION: FarTravel {"type":"FarTravel","destinationAreaId":"The Silent Verge"}

RESULT:
  ✗ No path to destination!

=== TICK 400 ===

REASONING:
  FarTravel failed with NO_PATH_TO_DESTINATION. Important learning:
  - "Undiscovered" areas cannot be reached via fartravel
  - I need to use the direct connection (16t) via "go" instead
  - FarTravel only works for known/discovered areas
  
  The Silent Verge is listed as a connection at 16t distance. I should use "go The Silent Verge" instead.
