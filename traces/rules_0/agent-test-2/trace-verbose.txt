================================================================================

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:

- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>

Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm starting fresh in a new game world with no skills, empty inventory, and only basic knowledge of the town square. I can see 6 different guilds and a warehouse service. To begin progressing, I should explore these guilds to understand what skills are available, what contracts they offer, and what the game mechanics are like. I'll start with the Miners Guild since resource gathering seems like a fundamental mechanic in this type of game.

ACTION: Go to Miners Guild

LEARNING: This is my first action, so no previous results to learn from yet.

Inventory: empty (0/20)
Skills: none
Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild and can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 copper bars to get 5 copper ore and +10 reputation. This seems backwards - usually you'd turn ore into bars, not the other way around. But this tells me copper bars and copper ore exist in the game. I can see I can either enroll in a skill or leave. Since I'm here to learn about mining, I should enroll in the Mining skill first.

ACTION: Enrol Mining

LEARNING: Travel to locations costs 0 ticks (T0). The Miners Guild has contracts that trade processed materials for raw materials, possibly to help players get started with gathering.

REASONING: I'm back at Town Square with Mining L1. Now I should explore other guilds to understand what skills are available and what the overall progression system looks like. Since I have Mining, I might want to look at Smithing Guild next to see how processing raw materials works. But first, let me check the Explorers Guild since that might reveal new areas where I can actually gather resources - I haven't seen any mining nodes yet.

Location: Town Square in TOWN

Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
Connections: none known

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm starting fresh in a new game world with no skills, empty inventory, and only basic knowledge of the town square. I can see 6 different guilds and a warehouse service. To begin progressing, I should explore these guilds to understand what skills are available, what contracts they offer, and what the game mechanics are like. I'll start with the Miners Guild since resource gathering seems like a fundamental mechanic in this type of game.

ACTION: Go to Miners Guild

LEARNING: This is my first action, so no previous results to learn from yet.

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm now at the Miners Guild and can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 copper bars to get 5 copper ore and +10 reputation. This seems backwards - usually you'd turn ore into bars, not the other way around. But this tells me copper bars and copper ore exist in the game. I can see I can either enroll in a skill or leave. Since I'm here to learn about mining, I should enroll in the Mining skill first.

ACTION: Enrol Mining

LEARNING: Travel to locations costs 0 ticks (T0). The Miners Guild has contracts that trade processed materials for raw materials, possibly to help players get started with gathering.

The only action available now is to leave, so I should return to Town Square to continue exploring. I want to check out other guilds to understand what skills and opportunities are available before deciding my next steps.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Enrolling in Mining cost 3 ticks and gave me Mining L1 with FOCUS ability. APPRAISE unlocks at L3. After enrolling, the only option is to leave the guild.

Since I have Mining, I might want to look at Smithing Guild next to see how processing raw materials works. But first, let me check the Explorers Guild since that might reveal new areas where I can actually gather resources - I haven't seen any mining nodes yet.

REASONING: I'm at the Explorers Guild and can see the same pattern as the Miners Guild - I can either enrol in a skill or leave. Since this is the Explorers Guild, there's likely an Exploration skill that will help me discover new areas where I can actually find mining nodes and other resources. Without new areas, I can't use my Mining skill. Let me enrol in the Exploration skill to unlock new destinations.

You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.

Now I need to leave and see if having Exploration skill has unlocked any new area connections from Town Square. With Exploration, I should be able to discover new wilderness areas where I can find mining nodes to actually use my Mining skill.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Exploration skill enrollment also costs 3 ticks, same as Mining. After enrolling, only option is to leave.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: Excellent! Now I can see that having Exploration L1 has unlocked a connection to "The Settled Heath" which takes 35 ticks to reach. This is my first wilderness area to explore. Since I have Mining skill, I should go there to look for mining nodes and start gathering resources. The travel time is significant (35 ticks) but this is likely where I'll find ore nodes to mine.

ACTION: Go to The Settled Heath

LEARNING: Exploration L1 unlocked the first area connection - The Settled Heath, which costs 35 ticks to travel to. This confirms that Exploration skill is needed to discover new areas.

--- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are playing a text-based game. Your goal is to: have fun

GAME OVERVIEW:
- This is a resource gathering and progression game
- Time is measured in "ticks" - each action costs some ticks
- Sessions are limited - you have a fixed number of ticks
- You have an inventory with limited slots
- You can learn skills and level them up through practice
- Some actions require specific skills or locations

AVAILABLE ACTION TYPES:
- Go: Travel to destinations - works for both:
  - Locations within an area (guilds, warehouse, ore vein, tree stand, enemy camp)
  - Other areas (Town, wilderness zones you've discovered connections to)
- Leave: Return to the hub/clearing from a location you've entered
- Enrol: Learn a new skill at the guild (one-time unlock)
- Gather: Extract resources from nodes (various modes available)
- Fight: Battle enemies (requires Combat skill and a weapon)
- Store: Put items in storage at town (frees inventory space)
- Drop: Discard items (takes time for disposal)
- AcceptContract: Accept a guild contract for rewards
- TurnInCombatToken: Unlock combat contracts

YOUR MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You only see what's visible at your current location
- When you leave a location, you won't see its details anymore
- Use the NOTES section to remember important discoveries
- Your notes persist between turns and are shown to you each turn
- Update your notes when you discover something worth remembering
- Examples of things worth noting:
  - Contracts you've seen (requirements, rewards, where to accept)
  - Recipes you've discovered at guild halls
  - Travel times between areas
  - Resource locations and what materials they have
  - Game mechanics you've figured out

DISCOVERY APPROACH:
- You start knowing nothing about the game world
- Explore to discover what exists
- When you visit somewhere new, observe what's available
- Write important discoveries in your NOTES so you remember them
- Learn from successes and failures

The game state will show you what's visible RIGHT NOW at your current location. Your NOTES (if any) will be shown separately.


Respond using this exact format:

REASONING: [Explain your thought process - what you understand about the game state, what you're trying to achieve, and why you're choosing this action]

ACTION: [The action to take - see action formats below]

LEARNING: [What you learned from the previous action result, if any. Note any new discoveries about game mechanics, costs, probabilities, or effects]

NOTES: [Optional - Your persistent memory. Update this to remember important discoveries you want to recall later. This replaces your previous notes entirely, so include everything you want to remember. Keep it concise but comprehensive.]

CONTINUE_IF: [Optional - condition for repeating the action, e.g., "inventory not full and node not depleted"]

Action formats:
- Go to <DESTINATION> (guild, service, node type, or area name)
- Leave (return to hub/clearing from a location)
- Enrol <SKILL>
- Gather node <NODE_ID> <MODE> [MATERIAL_ID]
  - Modes: FOCUS (requires material ID), CAREFUL_ALL, APPRAISE
- Fight <ENEMY_ID>
- Store <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- Drop <QUANTITY> <ITEM_ID>
- AcceptContract <CONTRACT_ID>
- TurnInCombatToken


Remember:
- Think before acting - consider what you know and don't know
- You only see your current location - use NOTES to remember other places
- Failed actions still cost time - learn from failures
- Document learnings, but put facts to remember in NOTES
- Your inventory has limited space - manage it wisely

Location: Miners Guild in TOWN

Actions: leave

[assistant]: REASONING: Great! I successfully enrolled in Mining skill for 3 ticks. I can see I now have Mining L1 with [FOCUS] ability, and I'll unlock APPRAISE at L3. The only action available now is to leave, so I should return to Town Square to continue exploring. I want to check out other guilds to understand what skills and opportunities are available before deciding my next steps.

ACTION: Leave

LEARNING: Enrolling in Mining cost 3 ticks and gave me Mining L1 with FOCUS ability. APPRAISE unlocks at L3. After enrolling, the only option is to leave the guild.

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm back at Town Square with Mining L1. Now I should explore other guilds to understand what skills are available and what the overall progression system looks like. Since I have Mining, I might want to look at Smithing Guild next to see how processing raw materials works. But first, let me check the Explorers Guild since that might reveal new areas where I can actually gather resources - I haven't seen any mining nodes yet.

ACTION: Go to Explorers Guild

LEARNING: Leaving locations costs 0 ticks (OK result). I'm back at the main hub where I can see all available destinations.

Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN

Actions: enrol || leave

[assistant]: REASONING: I'm at the Explorers Guild and can see the same pattern as the Miners Guild - I can either enrol in a skill or leave. Since this is the Explorers Guild, there's likely an Exploration skill that will help me discover new areas where I can actually find mining nodes and other resources. Without new areas, I can't use my Mining skill. Let me enrol in the Exploration skill to unlock new destinations.

ACTION: Enrol Exploration

LEARNING: The Explorers Guild follows the same pattern as Miners Guild - enrol or leave options only.

** The Settled Heath **

Unexplored (use explore action to start)

Connections closer to Town: 35t - Town

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
REASONING: I've reached The Settled Heath but it's unexplored - I need to use an "explore" action to start discovering what's here. This makes sense since I have Exploration L1 skill. Let me explore this area to see what resources and locations are available.

ACTION: explore

LEARNING: Moving to The Settled Heath cost 35 ticks as expected. New areas start unexplored and require using the "explore" action to discover what's available.
