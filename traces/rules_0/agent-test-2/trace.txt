TRACE LOG
================================================================================

=== TICK 0 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: none
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

REASONING:
  I'm starting fresh in a new game world with no skills, empty inventory, and only basic knowledge of the town square. I can see 6 different guilds and a warehouse service. To begin progressing, I should explore these guilds to understand what skills are available, what contracts they offer, and what the game mechanics are like. I'll start with the Miners Guild since resource gathering seems like a fundamental mechanic in this type of game.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_MINERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Miners Guild

LEARNING:
  This is my first action, so no previous results to learn from yet.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  Contracts: miners-guild-1 (2 COPPER_BAR → 5 COPPER_ORE, +10 rep)
  
  Location: Miners Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

REASONING:
  I'm now at the Miners Guild and can see there's a contract available (miners-guild-1) that requires 2 copper bars to get 5 copper ore and +10 reputation. This seems backwards - usually you'd turn ore into bars, not the other way around. But this tells me copper bars and copper ore exist in the game. I can see I can either enroll in a skill or leave. Since I'm here to learn about mining, I should enroll in the Mining skill first.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Mining"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Mining guild (3t)

LEARNING:
  Travel to locations costs 0 ticks (T0). The Miners Guild has contracts that trade processed materials for raw materials, possibly to help players get started with gathering.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections: none known

REASONING:
  Great! I successfully enrolled in Mining skill for 3 ticks. I can see I now have Mining L1 with [FOCUS] ability, and I'll unlock APPRAISE at L3. The only action available now is to leave, so I should return to Town Square to continue exploring. I want to check out other guilds to understand what skills and opportunities are available before deciding my next steps.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Miners Guild for Town Square

LEARNING:
  Enrolling in Mining cost 3 ticks and gave me Mining L1 with FOCUS ability. APPRAISE unlocks at L3. After enrolling, the only option is to leave the guild.

=== TICK 3 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3)
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: enrol || leave

REASONING:
  I'm back at Town Square with Mining L1. Now I should explore other guilds to understand what skills are available and what the overall progression system looks like. Since I have Mining, I might want to look at Smithing Guild next to see how processing raw materials works. But first, let me check the Explorers Guild since that might reveal new areas where I can actually gather resources - I haven't seen any mining nodes yet.

ACTION: TravelToLocation {"type":"TravelToLocation","locationId":"TOWN_EXPLORERS_GUILD"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to Explorers Guild

LEARNING:
  Leaving locations costs 0 ticks (OK result). I'm back at the main hub where I can see all available destinations.

=== TICK 6 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Explorers Guild in TOWN
  
  Actions: leave

REASONING:
  I'm at the Explorers Guild and can see the same pattern as the Miners Guild - I can either enrol in a skill or leave. Since this is the Explorers Guild, there's likely an Exploration skill that will help me discover new areas where I can actually find mining nodes and other resources. Without new areas, I can't use my Mining skill. Let me enrol in the Exploration skill to unlock new destinations.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Exploration"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Enrolled in Exploration guild, discovered The Settled Heath (35t travel time)

LEARNING:
  The Explorers Guild follows the same pattern as Miners Guild - enrol or leave options only.

=== TICK 6 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  Location: Town Square in TOWN
  
  Guilds (go to <name> to enter): Miners Guild, Foresters Guild, Combat Guild, Smithing Guild, Woodcrafters Guild, Explorers Guild
  Services (go to <name>): Warehouse
  Connections further from Town: 35t - The Settled Heath (unexplored)

REASONING:
  Excellent! I now have both Mining L1 and Exploration L1. The enrollment cost 3 ticks, same as Mining. Now I need to leave and see if having Exploration skill has unlocked any new area connections from Town Square. With Exploration, I should be able to discover new wilderness areas where I can find mining nodes to actually use my Mining skill.

ACTION: Leave {"type":"Leave"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Left Explorers Guild for Town Square

LEARNING:
  Exploration skill enrollment also costs 3 ticks, same as Mining. After enrolling, only option is to leave.

=== TICK 41 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Settled Heath **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 35t - Town

REASONING:
  Excellent! Now I can see that having Exploration L1 has unlocked a connection to "The Settled Heath" which takes 35 ticks to reach. This is my first wilderness area to explore. Since I have Mining skill, I should go there to look for mining nodes and start gathering resources. The travel time is significant (35 ticks) but this is likely where I'll find ore nodes to mine.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"area-d1-i0"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Traveled to The Settled Heath (35t)

LEARNING:
  Exploration L1 unlocked the first area connection - The Settled Heath, which costs 35 ticks to travel to. This confirms that Exploration skill is needed to discover new areas.

=== TICK 123 ===

STATE:
  Inventory: empty (0/20)
  Skills: Mining L1 [FOCUS] (APPRAISE@L3), Exploration L1
  
  ** The Settled Heath **
  
  Unexplored (use explore action to start)
  
  Connections closer to Town: 35t - Town
  Connections further from Town: 17t - The Silent Reach (undiscovered)

REASONING:
  I've reached The Settled Heath but it's unexplored - I need to use an "explore" action to start discovering what's here. This makes sense since I have Exploration L1 skill. Let me explore this area to see what resources and locations are available.

ACTION: Explore {"type":"Explore"}

RESULT:
  ✓ Discovered connection to The Silent Reach (17t travel time)
    +1 Exploration XP (24 to next level, 4% there)
    RNG: average (51% percentile) - took 82t, 2t slower than expected

LEARNING:
  Moving to The Settled Heath cost 35 ticks as expected. New areas start unexplored and require using the "explore" action to discover what's available.
