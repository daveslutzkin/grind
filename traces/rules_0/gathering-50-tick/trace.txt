  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  I'm starting a new game session with 50 ticks. I need to explore and learn the game mechanics. I can see several locations at different distances, and I have no skills enrolled yet. The closest locations are OUTSKIRTS_MINE and COPSE (3 ticks each), which likely contain mining and woodcutting resources respectively. Since I have no skills, I should first enrol in a skill to be able to gather resources. Mining seems like a good starting skill since it's typically fundamental in gathering games.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Mining"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Enrol
  Parameters: skill=Mining
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 0)
  Changes: Enrolled in Mining guild

LEARNING:
  Starting the game - no previous actions to learn from yet. I'm hypothesizing that enrolling in skills is necessary before being able to gather resources effectively.

  Resource nodes here:
    OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0 (ORE_VEIN):
      - COPPER_ORE: 74/74 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 94/94 units [requires Mining L1]
      - TIN_ORE: 54/54 units [requires Mining L2]

      - COPPER_ORE: 85/85 units [requires Mining L1]
      - TIN_ORE: 72/72 units [requires Mining L2]

REASONING:
  Successfully enrolled in Mining and it cost 3 ticks, starting me at Level 1 with 0 XP. Now I need to go to a mining location to gather resources and gain experience. The closest mining location appears to be OUTSKIRTS_MINE at 3 ticks away. This seems like the logical next step to start gathering and learning about mining mechanics.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Move
  Parameters: destination=OUTSKIRTS_MINE
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 3)
  Changes: Moved from TOWN to OUTSKIRTS_MINE

LEARNING:
  Enrolling in a skill costs 3 ticks and immediately gives Level 1 in that skill. Skills show both current level and XP progress toward the next level. The game tracks XP progression, suggesting that repeated actions will level up skills.

      - COPPER_ORE: 74/74 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 94/94 units [requires Mining L1]

      - COPPER_ORE: 85/85 units [requires Mining L1]
      - TIN_ORE: 72/72 units [requires Mining L2]

REASONING:
  Perfect! I can now see the resource nodes at this location. There are 5 ore veins with different materials. I can gather COPPER_ORE and STONE with my current Mining Level 1, but TIN_ORE requires Mining Level 2. I should start gathering to gain experience and resources. I'll try the CAREFUL_ALL mode first to see what it yields across all available materials at a node.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0","mode":"CAREFUL_ALL"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: FAILED ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=CAREFUL_ALL
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 6)
  Failure reason: MODE_NOT_UNLOCKED
  Changes: Failed: MODE_NOT_UNLOCKED

LEARNING:
  Moving between locations costs the stated number of ticks. Resource nodes show available materials with quantities and level requirements. Some materials (like TIN_ORE) require higher skill levels. The format shows current/maximum units available in each node.

=== TICK 11 ===

      - COPPER_ORE: 85/85 units [requires Mining L1]
      - TIN_ORE: 72/72 units [requires Mining L2]

REASONING:
  The CAREFUL_ALL mode is not unlocked yet, which suggests that gathering modes need to be unlocked through progression or skill levels. I should try the FOCUS mode instead, which requires specifying a material ID. I'll focus on COPPER_ORE since it's available at my current Mining level and might be a valuable resource.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"COPPER_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=FOCUS, focusMaterialId=COPPER_ORE
  Time used: 5 ticks (at tick 6)
  Changes: Focused extraction of 4 COPPER_ORE
  
  Items gained:
    +4x COPPER_ORE
    (0.6 units wasted from inefficiency)
    Collateral damage to other materials:
      STONE: -1 units
      TIN_ORE: -1 units
  
  XP gained: +5 Mining
  
  LEVEL UP!
    Mining: 1 -> 2

LEARNING:
  CAREFUL_ALL gathering mode is not available at Mining Level 1 - gathering modes appear to be unlocked as skills progress. Failed actions don't cost ticks, which is good for experimentation.

      - COPPER_ORE: 85/85 units [requires Mining L1]
      - TIN_ORE: 72/72 units [requires Mining L2]

REASONING:
  Excellent! The FOCUS mode worked and I gained valuable information. I extracted 4 COPPER_ORE in 5 ticks, gained 5 Mining XP, and leveled up to Mining Level 2! Now I can access TIN_ORE. The action had some inefficiency (0.6 units wasted) and caused collateral damage to other materials in the node. Since I'm now Level 2, I should try gathering TIN_ORE as it might be more valuable or give better XP. I'll continue with the same node since it has TIN_ORE available.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"TIN_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0, mode=FOCUS, focusMaterialId=TIN_ORE
  Time used: 5 ticks (at tick 11)
  Changes: Focused extraction of 4 TIN_ORE
  
  Items gained:
    +4x TIN_ORE
    (0.6 units wasted from inefficiency)
    Collateral damage to other materials:
      COPPER_ORE: -1 units
      STONE: -1 units
  
  XP gained: +10 Mining
  
  LEVEL UP!
    Mining: 2 -> 3

LEARNING:
  FOCUS gathering takes 5 ticks, extracts the target material with some inefficiency, and causes collateral damage to other materials in the node. Gathering gives XP (5 XP for this action) and can level up skills. At Mining Level 2, I can now access TIN_ORE. Items stack in inventory slots (4 COPPER_ORE takes 1 slot).

  Resource nodes here:
    OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-0 (ORE_VEIN):
      - COPPER_ORE: 69/74 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 92/94 units [requires Mining L1]
      - TIN_ORE: 49/54 units [requires Mining L2]
    OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-1 (ORE_VEIN):
      - STONE: 105/105 units [requires Mining L1]
      - COPPER_ORE: 93/93 units [requires Mining L1]
    OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-2 (ORE_VEIN):
      - COPPER_ORE: 98/98 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 98/98 units [requires Mining L1]
    OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-3 (ORE_VEIN):
      - COPPER_ORE: 104/104 units [requires Mining L1]
      - STONE: 113/113 units [requires Mining L1]
    OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-4 (ORE_VEIN):
      - STONE: 74/74 units [requires Mining L1]
      - COPPER_ORE: 85/85 units [requires Mining L1]
      - TIN_ORE: 72/72 units [requires Mining L2]

REASONING:
  Great! TIN_ORE gave me 10 XP instead of 5, suggesting higher-level materials give more experience. I'm now Mining Level 3 and progressing quickly. Now that I have some resources, I should explore other game mechanics. I could try the APPRAISE mode to learn more about nodes, or I could explore crafting since I have both COPPER_ORE and TIN_ORE (which might make bronze alloy). Let me try APPRAISE to understand nodes better first.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-1","mode":"APPRAISE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-1, mode=APPRAISE
  Time used: 1 ticks (at tick 16)
  Changes: Appraised node OUTSKIRTS_MINE-near_ore-1

LEARNING:
  TIN_ORE (higher level material) gives 10 XP compared to COPPER_ORE's 5 XP - higher skill requirement materials provide better experience rewards. The extraction mechanics remain consistent: 5 ticks, ~4 units extracted with 0.6 inefficiency, collateral damage to other materials in the node.

=== TICK 20 ===

STATE:
  === CURRENT STATE ===
  Location: TOWN
  Ticks remaining: 30 (used: 20)

    ANCIENT_GROVE (15 ticks)
  
  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  APPRAISE only took 1 tick, which is very efficient for gathering information, but I don't see any new information displayed about the node. It might reveal hidden details that aren't shown in the current interface, or perhaps the information is stored for later use. Now I should explore crafting possibilities. I have COPPER_ORE and TIN_ORE, which are commonly used to make bronze. I should head back to TOWN to see if there are crafting facilities or if I need to enrol in Smithing first.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"TOWN"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Move
  Parameters: destination=TOWN
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 17)
  Changes: Moved from OUTSKIRTS_MINE to TOWN

LEARNING:
  APPRAISE mode costs only 1 tick and seems to gather information about nodes, though the specific benefits aren't immediately visible in the current interface. This is much more time-efficient than FOCUS mode for information gathering.

    ANCIENT_GROVE (15 ticks)
  
  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  I'm back in TOWN with my gathered resources. I should enrol in Smithing to unlock crafting abilities since I have both COPPER_ORE and TIN_ORE which are likely smithing materials. This will let me explore the crafting mechanics and potentially create more valuable items from my raw materials.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Smithing"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Enrol
  Parameters: skill=Smithing
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 20)
  Changes: Enrolled in Smithing guild

LEARNING:
  Moving back from locations costs the same number of ticks as going there (3 ticks from OUTSKIRTS_MINE to TOWN). I'm now ready to explore crafting mechanics with my gathered materials.

=== TICK 23 ===

    ANCIENT_GROVE (15 ticks)
  
  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  I now have Smithing Level 1. I want to explore crafting, but I don't see any recipe information in the current state. I need to try crafting to discover what recipes are available. Since I have COPPER_ORE and TIN_ORE, a common combination would be bronze. Let me try crafting with a generic recipe ID to see what happens, or I could try a descriptive name like "BRONZE_BAR" or "BRONZE".

ACTION: Craft {"type":"Craft","recipeId":"BRONZE_BAR"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: FAILED ===
  Action: Craft
  Parameters: recipeId=BRONZE_BAR
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 23)
  Failure reason: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND
  Changes: Failed: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND

LEARNING:
  Smithing enrollment follows the same pattern as Mining - costs 3 ticks and starts at Level 1 with 0 XP. The game doesn't show available recipes in the interface, so I'll need to discover them through experimentation.

    ANCIENT_GROVE (15 ticks)
  
  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  The recipe "BRONZE_BAR" doesn't exist. I need to discover the correct recipe names. Let me try some other common variations like "BRONZE", "BRONZE_INGOT", or perhaps the recipes use different naming conventions entirely. I'll try "BRONZE" next.

ACTION: Craft {"type":"Craft","recipeId":"BRONZE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: FAILED ===
  Action: Craft
  Parameters: recipeId=BRONZE
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 23)
  Failure reason: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND
  Changes: Failed: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND

LEARNING:
  Failed crafting attempts don't cost ticks, which is helpful for discovering recipes. "BRONZE_BAR" is not a valid recipe ID. I need to experiment with different recipe names to discover what's available.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  "BRONZE" also doesn't work. Maybe I need to process the raw ores first into ingots or bars before making alloys. Let me try crafting individual metal bars first. I'll try "COPPER_BAR" since that might be a prerequisite step.

ACTION: Craft {"type":"Craft","recipeId":"COPPER_BAR"}

  Multiple recipe names I've tried don't exist ("BRONZE_BAR", "BRONZE"). The crafting system might require different naming conventions or perhaps I need to process raw ores into intermediate products first before making alloys.

REASONING:
  I'm not finding the correct recipe names through guessing. Maybe recipes need to be discovered through other means, or perhaps I need to explore other locations to find recipe information. Since I'm spending time inefficiently guessing recipes, let me try a different approach. I should explore more locations to see if there are crafting facilities, recipe books, or other sources of recipe information. Let me also try enrolling in Woodcutting to diversify my skills and explore the COPSE location.

LEARNING:
  Standard crafting recipe names like "COPPER_BAR", "BRONZE_BAR", and "BRONZE" don't exist. The recipe system might use different naming conventions, require discovery through exploration, or need specific facilities/NPCs to learn recipes.

REASONING:
  Good! Now I have both Mining Level 3 and Woodcutting Level 1. With 24 ticks remaining, I should explore the COPSE to see what woodcutting resources are available and potentially discover new mechanics or information about crafting. This will also help me understand the woodcutting system and diversify my resource gathering.

      - SOFTWOOD: 65/65 units [requires Woodcutting L1]

REASONING:
  Perfect! The COPSE has tree nodes with woodcutting materials. I can access GREEN_WOOD and SOFTWOOD with my Woodcutting Level 1, while HARDWOOD requires Level 2. This follows the same pattern as mining. Let me start gathering some wood to gain experience and resources. I'll focus on GREEN_WOOD first to see how woodcutting works.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"COPSE-near_trees-0","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"GREEN_WOOD"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=COPSE-near_trees-0, mode=FOCUS, focusMaterialId=GREEN_WOOD
  Time used: 5 ticks (at tick 29)
  Changes: Focused extraction of 4 GREEN_WOOD
  
  Items gained:
    +4x GREEN_WOOD
    (0.6 units wasted from inefficiency)
    Collateral damage to other materials:
      SOFTWOOD: -1 units
  
  XP gained: +5 Woodcutting
  
  LEVEL UP!
    Woodcutting: 1 -> 2

LEARNING:
  The COPSE location has TREE_STAND nodes instead of ORE_VEIN nodes, with wood materials (GREEN_WOOD, SOFTWOOD, HARDWOOD) that follow the same level requirement pattern as mining materials. The structure is consistent across resource types.

      - GREEN_WOOD: 99/99 units [requires Woodcutting L1]
      - SOFTWOOD: 65/65 units [requires Woodcutting L1]

REASONING:
  Excellent! Woodcutting follows the same mechanics as mining - 5 ticks, 4 units extracted, 0.6 inefficiency, collateral damage, and 5 XP for basic materials leading to a level up. Now I'm Woodcutting Level 2 and can access HARDWOOD. Since I have limited time (16 ticks) and want to explore more mechanics, let me try gathering HARDWOOD to see if higher-level wood gives more XP like TIN_ORE did.

ACTION: Gather {"type":"Gather","nodeId":"COPSE-near_trees-2","mode":"FOCUS","focusMaterialId":"HARDWOOD"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Gather
  Parameters: nodeId=COPSE-near_trees-2, mode=FOCUS, focusMaterialId=HARDWOOD
  Time used: 5 ticks (at tick 34)
  Changes: Focused extraction of 4 HARDWOOD
  
  Items gained:
    +4x HARDWOOD
    (0.6 units wasted from inefficiency)
    Collateral damage to other materials:
      GREEN_WOOD: -1 units
      SOFTWOOD: -1 units
  
  XP gained: +10 Woodcutting
  
  LEVEL UP!
    Woodcutting: 2 -> 3

LEARNING:
  Woodcutting mechanics are identical to mining: 5 ticks per FOCUS action, ~4 units extracted with 0.6 inefficiency, collateral damage to other materials, and 5 XP for basic materials. Level progression follows the same pattern - Level 1 materials give 5 XP and level up from 1 to 2.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Perfect! The pattern holds - HARDWOOD (Level 2 requirement) gives 10 XP just like TIN_ORE did. I now have both Mining Level 3 and Woodcutting Level 3, plus a diverse inventory of materials. With only 11 ticks remaining, I should head back to TOWN to try more crafting experiments with my expanded resource collection. Maybe having wood materials will unlock different crafting recipes, or I might need to enrol in Woodcrafting.

ACTION: Move {"type":"Move","destination":"TOWN"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Move
  Parameters: destination=TOWN
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 39)
  Changes: Moved from COPSE to TOWN

LEARNING:
  Higher-level materials consistently give double XP (10 instead of 5) across both Mining and Woodcutting skills. The progression pattern is universal: Level 1 materials give 5 XP, Level 2 materials give 10 XP. This suggests focusing on higher-level materials for faster skill progression.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  I'm back in TOWN with 8 ticks remaining and a good variety of materials. I should try crafting again with my expanded inventory. Maybe I need Woodcrafting skill for wood-based recipes, or maybe the combination of different material types unlocks recipes. Let me try enrolling in Woodcrafting first since I have 8 ticks and enrollment costs 3 ticks.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Woodcrafting"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Enrol
  Parameters: skill=Woodcrafting
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 42)
  Changes: Enrolled in Woodcrafting guild

LEARNING:
  Movement costs remain consistent - 3 ticks each way between TOWN and nearby locations (OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE). I now have a diverse material collection (ores and woods) that might unlock different crafting possibilities.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Now I have Woodcrafting Level 1 with only 5 ticks remaining. Let me try some crafting experiments with my wood materials. Maybe wood-based recipes use different naming conventions. I'll try "WOODEN_PLANK" or "PLANK" since that's a common wood crafting recipe.

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: FAILED ===
  Action: Craft
  Parameters: recipeId=PLANK
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 45)
  Failure reason: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND
  Changes: Failed: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND

LEARNING:
  Successfully enrolled in Woodcrafting - follows the same pattern as other skills (3 ticks, Level 1 start). Now I have 4 different skills: Mining L3, Woodcutting L3, Smithing L1, and Woodcrafting L1, giving me access to diverse crafting possibilities.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  "PLANK" doesn't work either. With only 5 ticks left, I should try one more crafting attempt with a different approach. Maybe the recipes use the exact material names or simpler conventions. Let me try "STAFF" since that might be a basic woodcrafting recipe using HARDWOOD.

ACTION: Craft {"type":"Craft","recipeId":"STAFF"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: FAILED ===
  Action: Craft
  Parameters: recipeId=STAFF
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 45)
  Failure reason: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND
  Changes: Failed: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND

LEARNING:
  "PLANK" is also not a valid recipe ID. The crafting system seems to use non-standard naming conventions that I haven't discovered yet. Recipe discovery might require specific NPCs, books, or other game mechanics I haven't encountered.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  With 5 ticks remaining and having failed to discover any crafting recipes, I should focus on exploring other game mechanics. Let me try the storage system to see how it works. I'll store some items to free up inventory space and learn about the storage mechanics.

ACTION: Store {"type":"Store","quantity":2,"itemId":"COPPER_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=COPPER_ORE, quantity=2
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 45)
  Changes: Stored 2 COPPER_ORE

LEARNING:
  Multiple recipe attempts have failed ("PLANK", "STAFF", "BRONZE_BAR", "BRONZE", "COPPER_BAR"). The crafting system likely requires recipe discovery through other means - perhaps NPCs, quest rewards, books, or specific skill levels. I need to explore beyond basic crafting attempts.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Excellent! Storage works and costs 0 ticks, which is very useful for inventory management. I can see my stored items in the "Storage (at TOWN)" section. With 5 ticks left, let me try to enrol in Combat to round out my skill set, as that's the only major skill I haven't tried yet.

ACTION: Enrol {"type":"Enrol","skill":"Combat"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Enrol
  Parameters: skill=Combat
  Time used: 3 ticks (at tick 45)
  Changes: Enrolled in Combat guild

LEARNING:
  Storage system works perfectly - costs 0 ticks to store items at TOWN, and stored items are tracked separately from inventory. This is crucial for inventory management since I have limited slots (20 total). Items remain accessible when at the storage location.

    ANCIENT_GROVE (15 ticks)
  
  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  Fantastic discovery! Enrolling in Combat automatically gave me a CRUDE_WEAPON, which is different from other skills that just gave me the ability to gather resources. With only 2 ticks remaining, I should store some items to better organize my inventory before the session ends, since storage costs 0 ticks.

ACTION: Store {"type":"Store","quantity":2,"itemId":"GREEN_WOOD"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=GREEN_WOOD, quantity=2
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 48)
  Changes: Stored 2 GREEN_WOOD

LEARNING:
  Combat enrollment is unique - it not only costs 3 ticks and grants Level 1 like other skills, but also automatically provides a CRUDE_WEAPON item. This suggests Combat works differently from gathering skills and might require weapons for fighting mechanics.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  With only 2 ticks remaining, I can't travel anywhere meaningful (all locations cost 3+ ticks). Let me use this time to try one more storage action to further organize my inventory and see if I can discover any other 0-tick actions or mechanics before the session ends.

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=HARDWOOD, quantity=2
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 48)

LEARNING:
  Storage continues to work efficiently at 0 ticks per action. This is excellent for inventory management and allows me to organize resources without time cost. The storage system maintains separate counts for each item type.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  With 2 ticks left and all locations requiring 3+ ticks to reach, I'm effectively at the end of this session. Let me try one final crafting attempt with a simple name format, perhaps using numbers or a completely different approach. I'll try "1" as a recipe ID to see if recipes use numeric identifiers.

ACTION: Craft {"type":"Craft","recipeId":"1"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: FAILED ===
  Action: Craft
  Parameters: recipeId=1
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 48)
  Failure reason: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND
  Changes: Failed: RECIPE_NOT_FOUND

LEARNING:
  Storage system is highly efficient - multiple 0-tick storage actions allow excellent inventory management. I can organize resources between active inventory and storage without any time penalty, which will be crucial for longer sessions with more materials.

  All world locations: TOWN, OUTSKIRTS_MINE, COPSE, OLD_QUARRY, DEEP_FOREST, ABANDONED_SHAFT, ANCIENT_GROVE

REASONING:
  With only 2 ticks remaining and having exhausted meaningful actions, I'll wait out the session. I've made excellent progress: enrolled in all major skills except one, reached Level 3 in both Mining and Woodcutting, discovered the storage system, obtained a weapon from Combat enrollment, and gathered diverse resources. The crafting system remains a mystery that I'll need to solve in future sessions through exploration or other discovery methods.

ACTION: Store {"type":"Store","quantity":1,"itemId":"TIN_ORE"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=TIN_ORE, quantity=1
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 48)
  Changes: Stored 1 TIN_ORE

LEARNING:
  Numeric recipe IDs ("1") also don't work. The crafting system requires discovery through means I haven't found yet - possibly NPCs, quest rewards, exploration of new locations, or achieving higher skill levels. This session was highly productive for establishing foundational skills and understanding core mechanics.

REASONING:
  I'm at the effective end of this session with only 2 ticks remaining and all locations requiring 3+ ticks to reach. This has been a very successful exploration session. I've established a strong foundation with multiple skills, discovered key mechanics, and set myself up well for future sessions. Let me organize my inventory one final time before the session ends.

ACTION: Store {"type":"Store","quantity":1,"itemId":"GREEN_WOOD"}

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=GREEN_WOOD, quantity=1
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 48)
  Changes: Stored 1 GREEN_WOOD

LEARNING:
  This session has been extremely productive for learning game mechanics:
  - Skill enrollment costs 3 ticks, starts at Level 1
  - Gathering follows consistent patterns (5 ticks, ~4 items, XP based on material level)
  - Level 1 materials give 5 XP, Level 2 materials give 10 XP
  - Storage costs 0 ticks and is excellent for inventory management
  - Combat enrollment uniquely provides a weapon
  - Crafting recipes remain undiscovered - likely need exploration of new areas or other discovery methods
  - Movement costs scale with distance
  - Multiple resource types (ores, woods) with level requirements

RESULT:
  === ACTION RESULT: SUCCESS ===
  Action: Store
  Parameters: itemId=HARDWOOD, quantity=1
  Time used: 0 ticks (at tick 48)
  Changes: Stored 1 HARDWOOD

LEARNING:
  This session successfully established core understanding of the game:
  - Resource gathering mechanics (timing, yields, XP progression)
  - Skill system (enrollment costs, level requirements, XP scaling)
  - Inventory management via 0-tick storage system
  - Multiple resource types and locations
  - Combat skill provides weapons unlike other skills
  - Crafting system exists but requires recipe discovery through unexplored means
  
  Next session priorities: explore distant locations, find crafting recipes, test combat, discover new materials and mechanics.
