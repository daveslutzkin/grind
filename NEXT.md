# NEXT: Future Design Work

Items that require design decisions before implementation. Important but not in current scope.

---

## 1. Contracts as Primary Decision Interface (Design Doc Gap)
**Description:** Design docs say contracts are "the primary interface for choosing risk, variance, and commitment" and should be "optimisation problems with terms." Currently contracts appear passively with no visible risk/reward/variance info. Need to make contracts the central pull of gameplay.

## 2. Strategic Exploration (Design Doc Gap)
**Description:** Design doc asks: "Does exploration make WHERE to explore more interesting than the ACT of exploring?" Currently it's pure button-mashing with no strategic choice. Need to surface knowledge bonuses, risk/reward of pushing deeper, and trade-offs between survey/explore.

## 3. Transformative Level-Ups (Design Doc Gap)
**Description:** Design docs say "every meaningful level unlocks a new action, risk profile, or removes a constraint." Currently level-ups feel invisible. Need to make unlocks explicit and impactful. The APPRAISE@L3 teaser is good - need more of this.

## 4. Early Inventory Pressure (Design Doc Gap)
**Description:** Design docs say "running out of space is expected, not exceptional." With 20 slots and slow gathering, inventory never creates decisions. Need earlier constraint to make inventory strategic.

## 5. Guild Depth (Design Doc Gap)
**Description:** Design docs say guilds are "primary progression scaffolding" with faction identity, reputation, and contracts. Currently just enrollment checkpoints. Need to add guild-specific flavor, meaningful reputation, and guild-driven contracts.
