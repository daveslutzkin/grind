name: detailed-change-planning
description: Creates a detailed change plan to give to an implementation agent. Use when planning or when the user asks to plan something or when the user asks "detailed plan please".
---

Plan by understanding the user's intention and the codebase.

DO NOT WRITE CODE.

Your goal is to create a detailed plan that will be handed off to a less capable implementation agent, to make changes you will then review.

When planning:

- Understand in detail the changes that will need to be made.
- Interview the user, one question at a time, to fully uncover their intention.
- When asking each question, give a full accounting of the tradeoffs associated with each option.
- Always give your recommended answer and explain why you think that's the answer.
